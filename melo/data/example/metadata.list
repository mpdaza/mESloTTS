data/example/wavs/7.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have always done as I pleased.
data/example/wavs/8.wav|EN-default|EN|until soon he was as ravenous as a bear.
data/example/wavs/9.wav|EN-default|EN|The little man petted and caressed them.

data/example/wavs/12.wav|EN-default|EN|His hunger grew and grew.
data/example/wavs/13.wav|EN-default|EN|The little fat man did not laugh.
data/example/wavs/14.wav|EN-default|EN|He was tired out and dripping with perspiration.
data/example/wavs/15.wav|EN-default|EN|and the coins tinkled under his tongue.
data/example/wavs/16.wav|EN-default|EN|and I can use it to make myself a drum-head.
data/example/wavs/17.wav|EN-default|EN|but Master Geppetto, in order to punish him for his mischief,

data/example/wavs/22.wav|EN-default|EN|when suddenly he heard heavy steps approaching.
data/example/wavs/23.wav|EN-default|EN|stopped and dropped Pinocchio softly to the ground.
data/example/wavs/24.wav|EN-default|EN|the thunder was so noisy and the lightning so bright
data/example/wavs/25.wav|EN-default|EN|His mouth opened wide and his tongue hung down on his chin.
data/example/wavs/26.wav|EN-default|EN|and the sea became as calm as a lake.
data/example/wavs/27.wav|EN-default|EN|You know now why you found a marionette and not a dead donkey when you pulled me out of the water.
data/example/wavs/28.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, Mother, help! I'm dying!
data/example/wavs/29.wav|EN-default|EN|He went straight to his friend's house to invite him to the party.

data/example/wavs/36.wav|EN-default|EN|After that he threw them into a large empty tub.

data/example/wavs/38.wav|EN-default|EN|and at last settled himself atop a heap of stones to wait for the serpent to go on his way,
data/example/wavs/39.wav|EN-default|EN|overflowing with boys from morning till night.
data/example/wavs/40.wav|EN-default|EN|He wiped his eyes, and then he made a bed of straw for old Geppetto.

data/example/wavs/42.wav|EN-default|EN|You should have thought of all this before.

data/example/wavs/54.wav|EN-default|EN|He'll make a fine fire for this.
data/example/wavs/55.wav|EN-default|EN|He wore a jaunty coat of chocolate-coloured velvet.
data/example/wavs/56.wav|EN-default|EN|Were you awake or asleep when they came?

data/example/wavs/67.wav|EN-default|EN|and in a few minutes he had reached the clouds.
data/example/wavs/68.wav|EN-default|EN|a small being that glowed with a pale, soft light.
data/example/wavs/69.wav|EN-default|EN|amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes,
data/example/wavs/70.wav|EN-default|EN|As soon as he regained the use of his senses, he said,
data/example/wavs/71.wav|EN-default|EN|They are your worst enemies, you know.
data/example/wavs/72.wav|EN-default|EN|where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit.
data/example/wavs/73.wav|EN-default|EN|his green eyes opened wide with surprise,
data/example/wavs/74.wav|EN-default|EN|carrying poor Pinocchio, who was wriggling and squirming like an eel and crying pitifully,
data/example/wavs/75.wav|EN-default|EN|How ridiculous I was as a marionette!
data/example/wavs/76.wav|EN-default|EN|and not knowing where to hide the gold pieces,
data/example/wavs/77.wav|EN-default|EN|A loud whirr of wings in quick flight was heard.
data/example/wavs/78.wav|EN-default|EN|he thought of his poor old father
data/example/wavs/79.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he turned to Geppetto and cried out weakly,
data/example/wavs/80.wav|EN-default|EN|I am the little man, the driver of the wagon which brought you here.

data/example/wavs/82.wav|EN-default|EN|Here comes our dear Pinocchio.
data/example/wavs/83.wav|EN-default|EN|and nothing satisfied him but to be allowed to ride in his wagon to that lovely place

data/example/wavs/88.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you, by chance, know of a marionette?"
data/example/wavs/89.wav|EN-default|EN|but you are going to be a sorry boy before very long.
data/example/wavs/90.wav|EN-default|EN|cried Pinocchio as he ran and jumped on his father's neck.

data/example/wavs/92.wav|EN-default|EN|But do you remember when you threw your hammer at me to kill me?
data/example/wavs/93.wav|EN-default|EN|said Pinocchio, bowing politely.
data/example/wavs/94.wav|EN-default|EN|he wanted to say a thousand and one things

data/example/wavs/103.wav|EN-default|EN|With all these blessings I have been able to live happily on for two whole years.

data/example/wavs/106.wav|EN-default|EN|Lies, my boy, are known in a moment.
data/example/wavs/107.wav|EN-default|EN|He wanted to give himself up to despair.
data/example/wavs/108.wav|EN-default|EN|He asked everyone whom he met about him.
data/example/wavs/109.wav|EN-default|EN|He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry.
data/example/wavs/110.wav|EN-default|EN|but in the meantime he began to feel hungry.
data/example/wavs/111.wav|EN-default|EN|He almost put the fairy's eyes out.
data/example/wavs/112.wav|EN-default|EN|He grasped that bundle in his mouth.

data/example/wavs/114.wav|EN-default|EN|Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home!
data/example/wavs/115.wav|EN-default|EN|decided the little rascal at last.
data/example/wavs/116.wav|EN-default|EN|worried now at the sight of his growing nose.
data/example/wavs/117.wav|EN-default|EN|I killed him to teach him.
data/example/wavs/118.wav|EN-default|EN|The streets were filled with people running to and fro about their tasks.
data/example/wavs/119.wav|EN-default|EN|He felt so embarrassed and ashamed.
data/example/wavs/120.wav|EN-default|EN|On reaching home he found the house door half open.
data/example/wavs/121.wav|EN-default|EN|Out with that money or you're a dead man.
data/example/wavs/122.wav|EN-default|EN|He had caught the weasels which had been eating his chickens.
data/example/wavs/123.wav|EN-default|EN|There stood the fox and the cat.
data/example/wavs/124.wav|EN-default|EN|An old man in a nightcap opened the window and looked out.
data/example/wavs/125.wav|EN-default|EN|eaten and digested by this time.
data/example/wavs/126.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio looked closely for a few minutes and then gave a sharp cry.
data/example/wavs/127.wav|EN-default|EN|My donkey has drawn the water for me.
data/example/wavs/128.wav|EN-default|EN|Tomorrow my father will be a rich man.
data/example/wavs/129.wav|EN-default|EN|That, as a sign of my particular esteem,
data/example/wavs/130.wav|EN-default|EN|An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds of dust.
data/example/wavs/131.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall use it to make the leg of a table.
data/example/wavs/132.wav|EN-default|EN|and the marionette still hoped for some good soul to come to his rescue
data/example/wavs/133.wav|EN-default|EN|and holding it lightly between his teeth,
data/example/wavs/134.wav|EN-default|EN|which look more or less like any other field,
data/example/wavs/135.wav|EN-default|EN|but i am of a generous nature and i gladly forgive him
data/example/wavs/136.wav|EN-default|EN|and the door still remained closed.
data/example/wavs/137.wav|EN-default|EN|answered the old man, rubbing his eyes.
data/example/wavs/138.wav|EN-default|EN|With a violent jerk it slipped out of his hands and hit against poor Geppetto's thin legs.
data/example/wavs/139.wav|EN-default|EN|that looked very much like a hen's egg.
data/example/wavs/140.wav|EN-default|EN|but on account of my laziness and my hatred of books
data/example/wavs/141.wav|EN-default|EN|then, remembering how his father had often told him that a kind deed is never lost,
data/example/wavs/142.wav|EN-default|EN|and once more stuck his nose into it.
data/example/wavs/143.wav|EN-default|EN|I had finally to resort to the gentle language of the whip.

data/example/wavs/145.wav|EN-default|EN|The Marionette grew more and more frightened.
data/example/wavs/146.wav|EN-default|EN|instead of feeling sorrowful and ashamed,
data/example/wavs/147.wav|EN-default|EN|trying with these words to find a little courage.
data/example/wavs/148.wav|EN-default|EN|and to think that the teacher had told me.
data/example/wavs/149.wav|EN-default|EN|Here it is only on Saturdays that we have no school.
data/example/wavs/150.wav|EN-default|EN|and he was able to eat only thirty-five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese
data/example/wavs/151.wav|EN-default|EN|almost unbelievable story.
data/example/wavs/152.wav|EN-default|EN|but I have spoken to him and now he seems quiet and reasonable.
data/example/wavs/153.wav|EN-default|EN|A third time he repeated his performance.

data/example/wavs/157.wav|EN-default|EN|Poor father would suffer terribly if I were to use you as firewood.
data/example/wavs/158.wav|EN-default|EN|appeared and disappeared in the waves.

data/example/wavs/162.wav|EN-default|EN|Whether less than more or less, we are always the same donkeys.

data/example/wavs/165.wav|EN-default|EN|The marionette opened the purse to find the money.

data/example/wavs/174.wav|EN-default|EN|He could not see the house where the fairy with the azure hair lived.
data/example/wavs/175.wav|EN-default|EN|A marionette fish does not come very often to these seas.
data/example/wavs/176.wav|EN-default|EN|and muffled like the buzz of a far-away mosquito.
data/example/wavs/177.wav|EN-default|EN|On hearing these words, the good little woman immediately said,
data/example/wavs/178.wav|EN-default|EN|We boys are really very unlucky.
data/example/wavs/179.wav|EN-default|EN|till they hang me to the branch of a giant oak tree
data/example/wavs/180.wav|EN-default|EN|but as he did so his hind legs caught in the ring
data/example/wavs/181.wav|EN-default|EN|great and sudden happiness that he almost dropped
data/example/wavs/182.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio went through the water like a shot.
data/example/wavs/183.wav|EN-default|EN|and after cutting a big hole at the top,
data/example/wavs/184.wav|EN-default|EN|I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea.
data/example/wavs/185.wav|EN-default|EN|A tremendous wave tossed him to the very spot where he wanted to be.
data/example/wavs/186.wav|EN-default|EN|After the eyes Geppetto made the nose, which began to stretch as soon as finished.
data/example/wavs/187.wav|EN-default|EN|till at last they caught me and tied my neck with a rope
data/example/wavs/188.wav|EN-default|EN|so that he might have something to eat.
data/example/wavs/189.wav|EN-default|EN|I should not find myself here now.

data/example/wavs/191.wav|EN-default|EN|The bass, the flounders, the whitefish, and even the little anchovies all went together into the tub to keep the mullets company.

data/example/wavs/277.wav|EN-default|EN|He waited for some sign of an answer to his questions.
data/example/wavs/278.wav|EN-default|EN|I can see him then as well as now.

data/example/wavs/281.wav|EN-default|EN|but one could hardly recognize them, they looked so miserable.

data/example/wavs/288.wav|EN-default|EN|From that day on, for more than five months,
data/example/wavs/289.wav|EN-default|EN|After a while he turned around again and called louder than before,

data/example/wavs/291.wav|EN-default|EN|How I wish midnight would strike.
data/example/wavs/292.wav|EN-default|EN|Some went at my legs and some at my back.
data/example/wavs/293.wav|EN-default|EN|said the fairy, taking a lump from a golden sugar bowl.
data/example/wavs/294.wav|EN-default|EN|as he spoke his nose, long though it was,
data/example/wavs/295.wav|EN-default|EN|Only imagined I heard the tiny voice.
data/example/wavs/296.wav|EN-default|EN|It was the same size as before.

data/example/wavs/306.wav|EN-default|EN|and I left the inn alone, and I met the assassins in the wood.
data/example/wavs/307.wav|EN-default|EN|and stretched out his hand to take the cover off.
data/example/wavs/308.wav|EN-default|EN|wriggling and dancing about in a fever of impatience,
data/example/wavs/309.wav|EN-default|EN|while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way.
data/example/wavs/310.wav|EN-default|EN|enjoying the spectacle and laughing till they cried at the antics of the two marionettes.
data/example/wavs/311.wav|EN-default|EN|for if they tickled the shark's long tongue,
data/example/wavs/312.wav|EN-default|EN|he started to run across the fields and meadows,
data/example/wavs/313.wav|EN-default|EN|One of them tried to put his hand in my mouth.

data/example/wavs/321.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you think that I want to lose the opportunity to taste such a rare fish?
data/example/wavs/322.wav|EN-default|EN|It's always a comfort to find oneself in good company.
data/example/wavs/323.wav|EN-default|EN|looked up at him sorrowfully and said,
data/example/wavs/324.wav|EN-default|EN|and today I am very sorry for it.
data/example/wavs/325.wav|EN-default|EN|Begging should be done only by the sick or the old.
data/example/wavs/326.wav|EN-default|EN|said the little fellow with far more common sense than the marionette.
data/example/wavs/327.wav|EN-default|EN|there is only one that really suits me.
data/example/wavs/328.wav|EN-default|EN|though their black sacks were drenched and dripping with water.
data/example/wavs/329.wav|EN-default|EN|Toward dawn the next morning they finally reached that much longed-for country.
data/example/wavs/330.wav|EN-default|EN|Where are the gold pieces now?
data/example/wavs/331.wav|EN-default|EN|And like all other mothers who love their children,
data/example/wavs/332.wav|EN-default|EN|He grasped the fairy's hands and kissed them so hard that it looked as if he had lost his head.
data/example/wavs/333.wav|EN-default|EN|Those greedy fish found out that the wood was not good.
data/example/wavs/334.wav|EN-default|EN|Great was his surprise to find that the voice came from the little flower-covered bundle that the fisherman held in his hand.
data/example/wavs/335.wav|EN-default|EN|but remember that fine clothes do not make the man.
data/example/wavs/336.wav|EN-default|EN|He flew away into space till he was out of sight.
data/example/wavs/337.wav|EN-default|EN|a tiny cottage built of straw.
data/example/wavs/338.wav|EN-default|EN|and cried out in a weak voice,
data/example/wavs/339.wav|EN-default|EN|no bigger than a nutshell floating on the sea.
data/example/wavs/340.wav|EN-default|EN|I ran away to the Marionette Theatre

data/example/wavs/345.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio was almost in tears.
data/example/wavs/346.wav|EN-default|EN|Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning."
data/example/wavs/347.wav|EN-default|EN|After tasting it, he chewed it well.
data/example/wavs/348.wav|EN-default|EN|said to him with eyes downcast in shame,
data/example/wavs/349.wav|EN-default|EN|You will cease to be a Marionette?
data/example/wavs/350.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio, mortified at being taken for a crab,
data/example/wavs/351.wav|EN-default|EN|much against her usual habit,
data/example/wavs/352.wav|EN-default|EN|and Pinocchio saw a large snail look out.
data/example/wavs/353.wav|EN-default|EN|at the sight of that pale little corpse,
data/example/wavs/354.wav|EN-default|EN|He did not have to wait very long for an offer.
data/example/wavs/355.wav|EN-default|EN|I had a bad fall and became lame.
data/example/wavs/356.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw a fine bunch of grapes hanging on a vine.
data/example/wavs/357.wav|EN-default|EN|a kind look shone in his eyes.
data/example/wavs/358.wav|EN-default|EN|in order to go in search of him across the ocean.
data/example/wavs/359.wav|EN-default|EN|and instead of making eight baskets,
data/example/wavs/360.wav|EN-default|EN|With it he wanted to buy himself a new suit.
data/example/wavs/361.wav|EN-default|EN|Come with us.
data/example/wavs/362.wav|EN-default|EN|He rubbed his eyes two or three times,
data/example/wavs/363.wav|EN-default|EN|I wish to state that there will be another performance tomorrow night.
data/example/wavs/364.wav|EN-default|EN|Tomorrow your wish will come true.
data/example/wavs/365.wav|EN-default|EN|The theater will be as light as day.
data/example/wavs/366.wav|EN-default|EN|carrying a pailful of plaster on his shoulder.
data/example/wavs/367.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio became very thoughtful.
data/example/wavs/368.wav|EN-default|EN|and I shall remember it as long as I live.
data/example/wavs/369.wav|EN-default|EN|a flowing white beard covered his chest and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles
data/example/wavs/370.wav|EN-default|EN|they burst forth into loud donkey brays,
data/example/wavs/371.wav|EN-default|EN|A few minutes later midnight struck.
data/example/wavs/372.wav|EN-default|EN|His head swam and he was so frightened.
data/example/wavs/373.wav|EN-default|EN|The wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages
data/example/wavs/374.wav|EN-default|EN|He approached the first donkey and tried to mount it.
data/example/wavs/375.wav|EN-default|EN|when a sudden gust of wind blew off Pinocchio's cap and made it go sailing far down the street.
data/example/wavs/376.wav|EN-default|EN|It was wrong of me to disobey father.
data/example/wavs/377.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have not enough words with which to thank you.
data/example/wavs/378.wav|EN-default|EN|He looked at Pinocchio and Lamp-Wick and said to them,
data/example/wavs/379.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you pretend by any chance that I should feed you duck or chicken?
data/example/wavs/380.wav|EN-default|EN|Swimming away as fast as he could, he cried out, laughing,
data/example/wavs/381.wav|EN-default|EN|and then something happened which almost caused a riot.
data/example/wavs/382.wav|EN-default|EN|and now and again even felt his hot breath blow over him.
data/example/wavs/383.wav|EN-default|EN|the sea was as smooth as glass.
data/example/wavs/384.wav|EN-default|EN|The day promised to be a very gay and happy one.
data/example/wavs/385.wav|EN-default|EN|When the fisherman pulled the net out of the sea, he cried out joyfully,
data/example/wavs/386.wav|EN-default|EN|He gave a quick leap and dived into the sea.
data/example/wavs/387.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you think, perhaps, my little donkey, that I am...
data/example/wavs/388.wav|EN-default|EN|and the tall oak-tree where he had been hanged,
data/example/wavs/389.wav|EN-default|EN|The farmer heard the loud barks and jumped out of bed.
data/example/wavs/390.wav|EN-default|EN|Fire-eater, on the other hand,
data/example/wavs/391.wav|EN-default|EN|and at last they came to the town called
data/example/wavs/392.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio promised to study and to behave himself.
data/example/wavs/393.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you think that a fish of that size will stand there waiting for you?
data/example/wavs/394.wav|EN-default|EN|to show you how grateful I am to you, Father.
data/example/wavs/395.wav|EN-default|EN|but I am wise enough to think that if one is
data/example/wavs/396.wav|EN-default|EN|building hundreds of castles in the air.
data/example/wavs/397.wav|EN-default|EN|and in a few days you'll be up and well.
data/example/wavs/398.wav|EN-default|EN|and the light of the talking cricket disappeared suddenly.
data/example/wavs/399.wav|EN-default|EN|for pinocchio ran in leaps and bounds
data/example/wavs/400.wav|EN-default|EN|and the white caps overturned the boat,
data/example/wavs/401.wav|EN-default|EN|He was much larger than a turkey.
data/example/wavs/402.wav|EN-default|EN|And why did you follow the advice of that false friend?"
data/example/wavs/403.wav|EN-default|EN|The fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio
data/example/wavs/404.wav|EN-default|EN|and with one leap landed on the donkey's back.
data/example/wavs/405.wav|EN-default|EN|That sly thief had fallen into deepest poverty.
data/example/wavs/406.wav|EN-default|EN|Could anything be worse?
data/example/wavs/407.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio walked to the door of the room.
data/example/wavs/408.wav|EN-default|EN|You'll go to school every day.
data/example/wavs/409.wav|EN-default|EN|even as I am the worst son that can be found.
data/example/wavs/410.wav|EN-default|EN|and as soon as he saw me in the water
data/example/wavs/411.wav|EN-default|EN|and at last he saw appear on the surface of the water
data/example/wavs/412.wav|EN-default|EN|ringing people's bells while they are
data/example/wavs/413.wav|EN-default|EN|For the same foolish reason I have lost the sight of
data/example/wavs/414.wav|EN-default|EN|And after having killed you?
data/example/wavs/415.wav|EN-default|EN|And do you hold any opinion?
data/example/wavs/416.wav|EN-default|EN|Still, judging by your face,
data/example/wavs/417.wav|EN-default|EN|Another day will be too late.
data/example/wavs/418.wav|EN-default|EN|he had to have four more helpings of
data/example/wavs/419.wav|EN-default|EN|One of the books was a very large volume.
data/example/wavs/420.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio, trying to feel very brave,
data/example/wavs/421.wav|EN-default|EN|they all ended by accepting the invitation with the words
data/example/wavs/422.wav|EN-default|EN|Now and again he looked back, and,
data/example/wavs/423.wav|EN-default|EN|said Pinocchio, scratching his head.
data/example/wavs/424.wav|EN-default|EN|Poor Pinocchio ran to the fireplace where the pot
data/example/wavs/425.wav|EN-default|EN|much wider than he was long,
data/example/wavs/426.wav|EN-default|EN|had to learn all these wonderful things.
data/example/wavs/427.wav|EN-default|EN|Never saw them in all these years.

data/example/wavs/429.wav|EN-default|EN|he put a hand as big as a spade into the net,

data/example/wavs/431.wav|EN-default|EN|A bone left by a dog would have tasted good to him.

data/example/wavs/434.wav|EN-default|EN|Won't someone come to save me?
data/example/wavs/435.wav|EN-default|EN|pale with fright and his eyes half out of his head with terror,
data/example/wavs/436.wav|EN-default|EN|there was something very strange about that.
data/example/wavs/437.wav|EN-default|EN|and the window closed without a sound.
data/example/wavs/438.wav|EN-default|EN|thus amusing himself with fancies,
data/example/wavs/439.wav|EN-default|EN|I wish you to know that I never have been a donkey.
data/example/wavs/440.wav|EN-default|EN|If you really want to go home, go ahead.
data/example/wavs/441.wav|EN-default|EN|It is so long, poor man, since I have seen him.
data/example/wavs/442.wav|EN-default|EN|think how great was his surprise when he saw that the donkey was weeping.
data/example/wavs/443.wav|EN-default|EN|he said to the fox and to the cat,
data/example/wavs/444.wav|EN-default|EN|The door of the stable was closed and he was left alone.
data/example/wavs/445.wav|EN-default|EN|I have never grown higher than a penny's worth of cheese.
data/example/wavs/446.wav|EN-default|EN|Give us some alms, we beg of you."
data/example/wavs/447.wav|EN-default|EN|when both of them fell on all fours and began running and jumping around the room,
data/example/wavs/448.wav|EN-default|EN|shuddered so hard that the bed shook.
data/example/wavs/449.wav|EN-default|EN|shouted Mastro Antonio in a surly voice.
data/example/wavs/450.wav|EN-default|EN|and how he enjoyed speaking ill of me.
data/example/wavs/451.wav|EN-default|EN|Will you be good enough to give me a bit of bread?
data/example/wavs/452.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sick, my little Dormouse.
data/example/wavs/453.wav|EN-default|EN|I have seen your father building a boat to look for you in America.
data/example/wavs/454.wav|EN-default|EN|But what do you want me to do, nailed to the door like this?
data/example/wavs/455.wav|EN-default|EN|These, as you know, are five new gold pieces.
data/example/wavs/456.wav|EN-default|EN|No, he is now alive, and he is already returned home.
data/example/wavs/457.wav|EN-default|EN|At that moment the door of the room flew open and in came four rabbits, as black as ink,
data/example/wavs/458.wav|EN-default|EN|answered Pinocchio, seeing that little animal busily playing with some shavings in the corner of the room.
data/example/wavs/459.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be eating some good bread and butter.
data/example/wavs/460.wav|EN-default|EN|after chewing and swallowing it in a twinkling,
data/example/wavs/461.wav|EN-default|EN|and he pulled out the gold pieces which Fire-Eater had given him.
data/example/wavs/462.wav|EN-default|EN|Don't listen to those who promise you wealth overnight.
data/example/wavs/463.wav|EN-default|EN|and poor Pinocchio began to scream and cry so loudly that he could be heard for miles around.
data/example/wavs/464.wav|EN-default|EN|I intend to go around the world.
data/example/wavs/465.wav|EN-default|EN|This LibriVox recording is in the public domain.
data/example/wavs/466.wav|EN-default|EN|Who has taught you to take things that do not?
data/example/wavs/467.wav|EN-default|EN|for he took off his cap and waved also.
data/example/wavs/468.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, help me. I can no longer stand up.
data/example/wavs/469.wav|EN-default|EN|she had azure hair and a face white as wax.
data/example/wavs/470.wav|EN-default|EN|The two figures leaped toward him as softly as if they were ghosts.
data/example/wavs/471.wav|EN-default|EN|Take the wood-path, and you'll surely meet him.
data/example/wavs/472.wav|EN-default|EN|and because I listened to bad companions,
data/example/wavs/473.wav|EN-default|EN|At the noise a window opened
data/example/wavs/474.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio saw a large rock in the middle of the sea.
data/example/wavs/475.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden marionette.
data/example/wavs/476.wav|EN-default|EN|I have cried so much, I have suffered so.
data/example/wavs/477.wav|EN-default|EN|That poor man certainly deserves it.
data/example/wavs/478.wav|EN-default|EN|his joints cracked and almost broke.
data/example/wavs/479.wav|EN-default|EN|Indeed, I know how much he disliked me.
data/example/wavs/480.wav|EN-default|EN|and then the talking cricket said to me,
data/example/wavs/481.wav|EN-default|EN|answered Geppetto, shaking his head and smiling sadly.
data/example/wavs/482.wav|EN-default|EN|Why don't you sow them in the field of wonders?
data/example/wavs/483.wav|EN-default|EN|A long iron chain was tied to the collar.
data/example/wavs/484.wav|EN-default|EN|I'll give you four if you will help me pull these two wagons.
data/example/wavs/485.wav|EN-default|EN|Home is near, and I'm going where Father is waiting for me.
data/example/wavs/486.wav|EN-default|EN|He tried to protest, but the two officers clapped their palms.
data/example/wavs/487.wav|EN-default|EN|I never succeeded in gaining my donkey's love.
data/example/wavs/488.wav|EN-default|EN|With bows and smiles he asked in a wheedling tone,
data/example/wavs/489.wav|EN-default|EN|No one can find happiness without work.
data/example/wavs/490.wav|EN-default|EN|and I see nothing but sea and sky.
data/example/wavs/491.wav|EN-default|EN|At least I have never believed in them.
data/example/wavs/492.wav|EN-default|EN|fancy his surprise when he saw that it was not a hand.
data/example/wavs/493.wav|EN-default|EN|Geppetto had a very bad temper.
data/example/wavs/494.wav|EN-default|EN|The mice might come and eat it from my head.
data/example/wavs/495.wav|EN-default|EN|the longer grew that impertinent nose.
data/example/wavs/496.wav|EN-default|EN|that I am going home where my father is waiting for me.
data/example/wavs/497.wav|EN-default|EN|and finally gave the door such a violent kick that it flew open.
data/example/wavs/498.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio ran all the way to Farmer John's house.
data/example/wavs/499.wav|EN-default|EN|My dear little fairy.
data/example/wavs/500.wav|EN-default|EN|Multiply 500 by 5.
data/example/wavs/501.wav|EN-default|EN|that I was right when I told you that one must not be a man of his word.
data/example/wavs/502.wav|EN-default|EN|You are free from this instant.
data/example/wavs/503.wav|EN-default|EN|and now my fairy will take care of me
data/example/wavs/504.wav|EN-default|EN|at the Field of Wonders at sunrise tomorrow morning.
data/example/wavs/505.wav|EN-default|EN|and spend all their days with toys and games
data/example/wavs/506.wav|EN-default|EN|And where is the new suit?
data/example/wavs/507.wav|EN-default|EN|during which time the two friends looked at each other in a mocking way.
data/example/wavs/508.wav|EN-default|EN|more so than he had ever been before.
data/example/wavs/509.wav|EN-default|EN|We do not work for gain.

data/example/wavs/540.wav|EN-default|EN|How long does it take from here to the shore?

data/example/wavs/561.wav|EN-default|EN|This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world.

data/example/wavs/577.wav|EN-default|EN|to scream, to knock his head against the wall.
data/example/wavs/578.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, how much better it would have been!

data/example/wavs/636.wav|EN-default|EN|The time has come for us to escape.

data/example/wavs/640.wav|EN-default|EN|And what elbows! They're even harder than the feet.
data/example/wavs/641.wav|EN-default|EN|cried the boy, rubbing the spot where the marionette had kicked him.

data/example/wavs/643.wav|EN-default|EN|Come to my arms and kiss me.
data/example/wavs/644.wav|EN-default|EN|in order to give all their time to nonsense and pleasure,
data/example/wavs/645.wav|EN-default|EN|As Pinocchio, growing tired of waiting,

data/example/wavs/647.wav|EN-default|EN|What does the teacher think of us, you mean?

data/example/wavs/649.wav|EN-default|EN|was composed wholly of boys.
data/example/wavs/650.wav|EN-default|EN|sent a large mastiff after him.
data/example/wavs/651.wav|EN-default|EN|as if he were a real coachman in a hurry to get to the

data/example/wavs/653.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio, who was wild with curiosity to know what was going on inside,
data/example/wavs/654.wav|EN-default|EN|As he walked his feet splashed in a pool of greasy and slippery water.

data/example/wavs/658.wav|EN-default|EN|wondering if he were still asleep or awake.
data/example/wavs/659.wav|EN-default|EN|looked about him to see whence the words had come.

data/example/wavs/666.wav|EN-default|EN|And now what are we to do here in the dark?
data/example/wavs/667.wav|EN-default|EN|He felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another.
data/example/wavs/668.wav|EN-default|EN|and after tying them in a bag said to them in a happy voice,

data/example/wavs/680.wav|EN-default|EN|Geppetto, no doubt, will beat him unmercifully. He is so mean and cruel.
data/example/wavs/681.wav|EN-default|EN|the pangs of hunger grew so strong that
data/example/wavs/682.wav|EN-default|EN|He lifted his eyes to his fairy and said seriously,
data/example/wavs/683.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere and finally discovered him hiding near a farmer's wagon.
data/example/wavs/684.wav|EN-default|EN|who was beginning to waver and weaken in his good resolutions.

data/example/wavs/689.wav|EN-default|EN|He found out I was innocent when I caught the weasels.
data/example/wavs/690.wav|EN-default|EN|He learned to mumble a few words when he lived for three years with a band of trained dogs.
data/example/wavs/691.wav|EN-default|EN|He is still today as savage as the day I found him.

data/example/wavs/714.wav|EN-default|EN|In a twinkling the tree began to sputter and burn like a candle blown by the wind.

data/example/wavs/717.wav|EN-default|EN|both hands fully determined to awaken the whole house and street with it.

data/example/wavs/768.wav|EN-default|EN|when the judge heard i had been robbed

data/example/wavs/788.wav|EN-default|EN|his body not counting the tail
data/example/wavs/789.wav|EN-default|EN|Without another word, he swam swiftly away in an effort to reach land as soon as possible.

data/example/wavs/791.wav|EN-default|EN|said the talking cricket in his calm voice.

data/example/wavs/823.wav|EN-default|EN|I awoke to find myself changed into a donkey.
data/example/wavs/824.wav|EN-default|EN|and this candle you see here is the last one I have.
data/example/wavs/825.wav|EN-default|EN|But remember, you were the one to throw it at my legs.

data/example/wavs/830.wav|EN-default|EN|Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses.
data/example/wavs/831.wav|EN-default|EN|but as he was about to give it to his friend,
data/example/wavs/832.wav|EN-default|EN|My friend is too modest to answer.

data/example/wavs/835.wav|EN-default|EN|If it wasn't you, who was it then?
data/example/wavs/836.wav|EN-default|EN|but the most horrible moment was the one in which the two poor creatures felt their tails appear.
data/example/wavs/837.wav|EN-default|EN|when the shark sneezed very suddenly.
data/example/wavs/838.wav|EN-default|EN|What does it matter after all?
data/example/wavs/839.wav|EN-default|EN|pulled far down to his very nose.

data/example/wavs/850.wav|EN-default|EN|In less than an hour the feet were finished.
data/example/wavs/851.wav|EN-default|EN|after a long, long look,
data/example/wavs/852.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps he did not think he would strike it.
data/example/wavs/853.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio asked for permission to give out the invitations.

data/example/wavs/857.wav|EN-default|EN|He suffered keenly at the thought of passing under the windows of his good little fairy's

data/example/wavs/859.wav|EN-default|EN|and among the others there was one tiny fish
data/example/wavs/860.wav|EN-default|EN|when they reached the throat of the monster,
data/example/wavs/861.wav|EN-default|EN|Come to the arms of your wooden brothers.
data/example/wavs/862.wav|EN-default|EN|That Marionette is not a stranger to me.
data/example/wavs/863.wav|EN-default|EN|if we want to find kindness and courtesy in our...
data/example/wavs/864.wav|EN-default|EN|as he no longer had any strength left with which to stand,
data/example/wavs/865.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall make the same terms with you that we had with the dead Malampo.
data/example/wavs/866.wav|EN-default|EN|he found it more to his taste to go under it.
data/example/wavs/867.wav|EN-default|EN|and the little fat man sang sleepily between his teeth.
data/example/wavs/868.wav|EN-default|EN|and bending low over him he asked,

data/example/wavs/870.wav|EN-default|EN|difficulties which I have encountered,
data/example/wavs/871.wav|EN-default|EN|asked Pinocchio in astonishment.
data/example/wavs/872.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague.
data/example/wavs/873.wav|EN-default|EN|for the silly reason of wanting to study

data/example/wavs/875.wav|EN-default|EN|back, Pinocchio put it on his own head.
data/example/wavs/876.wav|EN-default|EN|When he reached the giant oak tree, he stopped.
data/example/wavs/877.wav|EN-default|EN|We will make you a present of one of the chickens for your breakfast.
data/example/wavs/878.wav|EN-default|EN|He said after eating the last one,
data/example/wavs/879.wav|EN-default|EN|but as he was about to give it the first blow,
data/example/wavs/880.wav|EN-default|EN|Over the fire there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away,
data/example/wavs/881.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he pulled a wooden bowl full of flour out of a cupboard and started to roll the fish into it.
data/example/wavs/882.wav|EN-default|EN|Bleeded the little goat on the high rock.
data/example/wavs/883.wav|EN-default|EN|and a library of candies and fruits
data/example/wavs/884.wav|EN-default|EN|grieving for their bright feathers of gold and silver,
data/example/wavs/885.wav|EN-default|EN|He stood still with arm uplifted.
data/example/wavs/886.wav|EN-default|EN|We can run out of the shark's mouth and dive into the sea.
data/example/wavs/887.wav|EN-default|EN|and after the cauliflower some cake

data/example/wavs/898.wav|EN-default|EN|Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball.
data/example/wavs/899.wav|EN-default|EN|but I cannot swim, my dear Pinocchio.
data/example/wavs/900.wav|EN-default|EN|I have waited too long as it is.
data/example/wavs/901.wav|EN-default|EN|and there they found nothing but a bowl of water and a small basket filled with chickpeas.
data/example/wavs/902.wav|EN-default|EN|cried the farmer, slapping him on the shoulder in a friendly way.
data/example/wavs/903.wav|EN-default|EN|In the morning you may come with me to the inn.
data/example/wavs/904.wav|EN-default|EN|Far from giving up the chase, this only spurred them on.
data/example/wavs/905.wav|EN-default|EN|digging busily with teeth and claws,
data/example/wavs/906.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio was able to catch a glimpse of the sky filled with stars.

data/example/wavs/913.wav|EN-default|EN|Finally, however, he lost all patience, and turning to his tormentors,
data/example/wavs/914.wav|EN-default|EN|This speech was greeted by much laughter and applause.
data/example/wavs/915.wav|EN-default|EN|This morning a fine idea came to me.
data/example/wavs/916.wav|EN-default|EN|With that kick and that blow, Pinocchio gained everybody's favor.

data/example/wavs/1261.wav|EN-default|EN|setting the two jugs on the ground before him,
data/example/wavs/1262.wav|EN-default|EN|I can't digest straw.
data/example/wavs/1263.wav|EN-default|EN|and holding the glass with his two hands he swallowed the medicine at one gulp.

data/example/wavs/1310.wav|EN-default|EN|Quick as a flash, the marionette sank his teeth deep into the assassin's hand.
data/example/wavs/1311.wav|EN-default|EN|he found himself in a beautifully furnished little room.

data/example/wavs/1313.wav|EN-default|EN|fiery eyes which glowed and burned.
data/example/wavs/1314.wav|EN-default|EN|Might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child?

data/example/wavs/1317.wav|EN-default|EN|He redoubled his efforts and swam as hard as he could toward the white rock.
data/example/wavs/1318.wav|EN-default|EN|He gave a long sigh and mumbled with a faint voice,
data/example/wavs/1319.wav|EN-default|EN|like two dogs chasing a hare.

data/example/wavs/1326.wav|EN-default|EN|Now who will return my money to me?
data/example/wavs/1327.wav|EN-default|EN|and after turning him over and over he said at last,
data/example/wavs/1328.wav|EN-default|EN|In a few seconds he had gone so far he could hardly be seen.
data/example/wavs/1329.wav|EN-default|EN|and he kept his word for the remainder of the year.
data/example/wavs/1330.wav|EN-default|EN|shrugging his shoulders and pointing to his forehead.
data/example/wavs/1331.wav|EN-default|EN|He was awakened by three loud knocks at the door.
data/example/wavs/1332.wav|EN-default|EN|At these last words Pinocchio jumped up in a fury,
data/example/wavs/1333.wav|EN-default|EN|to your poor old father.

data/example/wavs/1345.wav|EN-default|EN|As he ran, he was splashed with mud even up to his cap.

data/example/wavs/1361.wav|EN-default|EN|I have reached the conclusion that
data/example/wavs/1362.wav|EN-default|EN|He was worn out from hunger and too much work.
data/example/wavs/1363.wav|EN-default|EN|Suddenly a huge wave came,
data/example/wavs/1364.wav|EN-default|EN|For the last time, are you coming or not?
data/example/wavs/1365.wav|EN-default|EN|the most famous donkey in the world.
data/example/wavs/1366.wav|EN-default|EN|as he was so in need of strength.

data/example/wavs/1385.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio understood that the boys had played a trick on him.
data/example/wavs/1386.wav|EN-default|EN|After resting a few minutes longer,
data/example/wavs/1387.wav|EN-default|EN|asked Pinocchio, who was burning up with thirst.
data/example/wavs/1388.wav|EN-default|EN|He looked over the waters to see whether he might catch sight of a boat with a little man in it.
data/example/wavs/1389.wav|EN-default|EN|cat's tails twisted together

data/example/wavs/1399.wav|EN-default|EN|ashamed and hurt by these words, did not answer.
data/example/wavs/1400.wav|EN-default|EN|but no sooner had they tasted a page or two than they spat them out with a wry face, as if to say,
data/example/wavs/1401.wav|EN-default|EN|trembled like leaves in a storm.
data/example/wavs/1402.wav|EN-default|EN|so that whenever he breathed a storm seemed to blow.
data/example/wavs/1403.wav|EN-default|EN|In a twinkling he was far away from land.

data/example/wavs/1408.wav|EN-default|EN|At this speech his nose returned to its natural size.
data/example/wavs/1409.wav|EN-default|EN|the battle waxed more and more furious.
data/example/wavs/1410.wav|EN-default|EN|the fox unconsciously held out his paw that was supposed to be lame,
data/example/wavs/1411.wav|EN-default|EN|even if one were to search with a lantern.

data/example/wavs/1415.wav|EN-default|EN|The assassins called to him mockingly,

data/example/wavs/1417.wav|EN-default|EN|began to run like a lizard under a summer sun.
data/example/wavs/1418.wav|EN-default|EN|and next morning the good times begin all over again.
data/example/wavs/1419.wav|EN-default|EN|I was just going to buy some clothes.

data/example/wavs/1433.wav|EN-default|EN|Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets.

data/example/wavs/1436.wav|EN-default|EN|It's the fault of this piece of wood.
data/example/wavs/1437.wav|EN-default|EN|and from an illness which frightens me.
data/example/wavs/1438.wav|EN-default|EN|At first he made a wry face, but one after another the skins and the cores disappeared.
data/example/wavs/1439.wav|EN-default|EN|A great sash of gold and silver was fastened around its waist,

data/example/wavs/1443.wav|EN-default|EN|I'll buy Father a new cloth coat.
data/example/wavs/1444.wav|EN-default|EN|because that feather pillow on my feet

data/example/wavs/1446.wav|EN-default|EN|but to his amazement the pot was only painted.
data/example/wavs/1447.wav|EN-default|EN|then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead.
data/example/wavs/1448.wav|EN-default|EN|and there he stood with his legs straight up in the air.
data/example/wavs/1449.wav|EN-default|EN|In the street there was such a racket, such shouting, such blowing of trumpets.
data/example/wavs/1450.wav|EN-default|EN|Even mischievous boys understand what it

data/example/wavs/1646.wav|EN-default|EN|He thought he heard sounds of pipes and drums coming from a distance.
data/example/wavs/1647.wav|EN-default|EN|and put the skins in a row on the table.

data/example/wavs/2015.wav|EN-default|EN|in the hope of selling them at a good price.

data/example/wavs/2022.wav|EN-default|EN|There will be more than a hundred of us.

data/example/wavs/2024.wav|EN-default|EN|as he wiped his eyes with some straw he had picked up from the ground.
data/example/wavs/2025.wav|EN-default|EN|He felt so happy that he tried his best to cry out,

data/example/wavs/2067.wav|EN-default|EN|seeing himself so near to death.
data/example/wavs/2068.wav|EN-default|EN|and Geppetto had two buttons missing from his coat.

data/example/wavs/2070.wav|EN-default|EN|at the cheerful tinkle of the gold,
data/example/wavs/2071.wav|EN-default|EN|a little because of fright at finding himself alone in the darkness of the field,

data/example/wavs/2077.wav|EN-default|EN|from the answers and the laughter which followed them,
data/example/wavs/2078.wav|EN-default|EN|bathed the head of his poor little schoolmate.

data/example/wavs/2102.wav|EN-default|EN|As soon as Pinocchio no longer felt the shameful weight of the dog-collar around his neck,
data/example/wavs/2103.wav|EN-default|EN|And if you wish to stay with me.
data/example/wavs/2104.wav|EN-default|EN|He used a long stick at one end of which he had whittled a long fine point.
data/example/wavs/2105.wav|EN-default|EN|It was not an expensive piece of wood.
data/example/wavs/2106.wav|EN-default|EN|Among all his books he liked that one the best.
data/example/wavs/2107.wav|EN-default|EN|All he could do was to seize Pinocchio by the back of the neck and take him home.
data/example/wavs/2108.wav|EN-default|EN|No sooner had he reached the grape-vine than
data/example/wavs/2109.wav|EN-default|EN|pointing to Pinocchio, said in a very solemn voice,
data/example/wavs/2110.wav|EN-default|EN|Before starting out, the officers called out to several fishermen passing by in a boat,
data/example/wavs/2111.wav|EN-default|EN|all ready for your breakfast in the morning.
data/example/wavs/2112.wav|EN-default|EN|He ran out of the house without another word.
data/example/wavs/2113.wav|EN-default|EN|he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke.
data/example/wavs/2114.wav|EN-default|EN|for as soon as I loosened the knot around his neck,
data/example/wavs/2115.wav|EN-default|EN|it is impossible to describe it
data/example/wavs/2116.wav|EN-default|EN|lifted a leg or an arm in the air.
data/example/wavs/2117.wav|EN-default|EN|He gave Fire Eater a loving kiss on the cheek.
data/example/wavs/2118.wav|EN-default|EN|dashed once more and very unceremoniously.
data/example/wavs/2119.wav|EN-default|EN|and angrier than ever he gave poor Pinocchio another lashing.

data/example/wavs/2125.wav|EN-default|EN|One person after another gathered around the two.
data/example/wavs/2126.wav|EN-default|EN|and even looked under the bed in search of a piece of

data/example/wavs/2136.wav|EN-default|EN|I tickled myself under the wings.
data/example/wavs/2137.wav|EN-default|EN|seeing his followers hot and tired,

data/example/wavs/2157.wav|EN-default|EN|but that night he ate them with a relish.
data/example/wavs/2158.wav|EN-default|EN|And there on a beam sat the talking cricket.

data/example/wavs/2695.wav|EN-default|EN|you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there.

data/example/wavs/2913.wav|EN-default|EN|cheery sitting-room behind me

data/example/wavs/2919.wav|EN-default|EN|May I see your father if I call to-morrow?
data/example/wavs/2920.wav|EN-default|EN|cried Lestrade with some bitterness.
data/example/wavs/2921.wav|EN-default|EN|After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked

data/example/wavs/2946.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack, smack, smack!
data/example/wavs/2947.wav|EN-default|EN|He was kind to her also in his bluff.
data/example/wavs/2948.wav|EN-default|EN|if a real effect were to be produced.
data/example/wavs/2949.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I'll tell our story right away.
data/example/wavs/2950.wav|EN-default|EN|there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men
data/example/wavs/2951.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes immediately bent his strength upon it.

data/example/wavs/2957.wav|EN-default|EN|but here are three separate tracks of the same feet.

data/example/wavs/2972.wav|EN-default|EN|I know the military neatness which characterizes you.
data/example/wavs/2973.wav|EN-default|EN|I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room.
data/example/wavs/2974.wav|EN-default|EN|that I could think of nothing except of my father.
data/example/wavs/2975.wav|EN-default|EN|A husband's cruelty to his wife.
data/example/wavs/2976.wav|EN-default|EN|It is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling.
data/example/wavs/2977.wav|EN-default|EN|You'll see your pal again presently.
data/example/wavs/2978.wav|EN-default|EN|I am a widower and have an only son.
data/example/wavs/2979.wav|EN-default|EN|is a somewhat rare accomplishment.

data/example/wavs/2981.wav|EN-default|EN|and having closed the door and bowed her into an arm-chair,
data/example/wavs/2982.wav|EN-default|EN|Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat.
data/example/wavs/2983.wav|EN-default|EN|for he had started to England just before it arrived.
data/example/wavs/2984.wav|EN-default|EN|not a trace remained of the machinery,
data/example/wavs/2985.wav|EN-default|EN|his expression, his manner.
data/example/wavs/2986.wav|EN-default|EN|and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it.
data/example/wavs/2987.wav|EN-default|EN|and found that i had to deal with one of the
data/example/wavs/2988.wav|EN-default|EN|which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending council.
data/example/wavs/2989.wav|EN-default|EN|That need cause you no inconvenience.
data/example/wavs/2990.wav|EN-default|EN|and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk.
data/example/wavs/2991.wav|EN-default|EN|but there is some stiffness in the working of it,
data/example/wavs/2992.wav|EN-default|EN|and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beaches in front of the door.
data/example/wavs/2993.wav|EN-default|EN|though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,
data/example/wavs/2994.wav|EN-default|EN|Both Mr. and Mrs. Rewcastle expressed a delight at the look of it,
data/example/wavs/2995.wav|EN-default|EN|and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.
data/example/wavs/2996.wav|EN-default|EN|I may say that it has occurred to me as possible
data/example/wavs/2997.wav|EN-default|EN|and made our way over to England without being suspected.
data/example/wavs/2998.wav|EN-default|EN|of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the

data/example/wavs/3000.wav|EN-default|EN|beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour,
data/example/wavs/3001.wav|EN-default|EN|You no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way.
data/example/wavs/3002.wav|EN-default|EN|but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad.
data/example/wavs/3003.wav|EN-default|EN|there will probably be some small
data/example/wavs/3004.wav|EN-default|EN|He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day.
data/example/wavs/3005.wav|EN-default|EN|I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.'
data/example/wavs/3006.wav|EN-default|EN|said our strange visitor, setting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead.
data/example/wavs/3007.wav|EN-default|EN|and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key
data/example/wavs/3008.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is the note written in pencil over here.
data/example/wavs/3009.wav|EN-default|EN|and behind this i drove one of the birds
data/example/wavs/3010.wav|EN-default|EN|That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into, just at
data/example/wavs/3011.wav|EN-default|EN|Then, as to sitting here or there,
data/example/wavs/3012.wav|EN-default|EN|Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom.
data/example/wavs/3013.wav|EN-default|EN|and out into the bright morning sunshine.
data/example/wavs/3014.wav|EN-default|EN|elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
data/example/wavs/3015.wav|EN-default|EN|as no doubt you have divined.
data/example/wavs/3016.wav|EN-default|EN|was admiring your fuller's earth.
data/example/wavs/3017.wav|EN-default|EN|The envelope was a very coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark,
data/example/wavs/3018.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.
data/example/wavs/3019.wav|EN-default|EN|we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.
data/example/wavs/3020.wav|EN-default|EN|were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled.
data/example/wavs/3021.wav|EN-default|EN|It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man.
data/example/wavs/3022.wav|EN-default|EN|a series of disgraceful brawls took place.
data/example/wavs/3023.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling.
data/example/wavs/3024.wav|EN-default|EN|It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Heatherley.
data/example/wavs/3025.wav|EN-default|EN|and suddenly an idea came into my head
data/example/wavs/3026.wav|EN-default|EN|and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
data/example/wavs/3027.wav|EN-default|EN|and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me.
data/example/wavs/3028.wav|EN-default|EN|He heard a soft tread pass his door.
data/example/wavs/3029.wav|EN-default|EN|The lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair.
data/example/wavs/3030.wav|EN-default|EN|mr aloysius durand in conjunction with the bridegroom
data/example/wavs/3031.wav|EN-default|EN|and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
data/example/wavs/3032.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes.
data/example/wavs/3033.wav|EN-default|EN|I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder.
data/example/wavs/3034.wav|EN-default|EN|she cried, shaking hands with us warmly.
data/example/wavs/3035.wav|EN-default|EN|Then you don't think I'll see him again?
data/example/wavs/3036.wav|EN-default|EN|I may be on the trail in this matter.
data/example/wavs/3037.wav|EN-default|EN|You mean the little problem of the Grossman or Square furniture van.
data/example/wavs/3038.wav|EN-default|EN|would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it.
data/example/wavs/3039.wav|EN-default|EN|and I am not easy in my mind about them.
data/example/wavs/3040.wav|EN-default|EN|In an instant his strange head-gear began to move.
data/example/wavs/3041.wav|EN-default|EN|and away we drove to some lodgings,

data/example/wavs/3043.wav|EN-default|EN|To Sherlock Holmes she is always
data/example/wavs/3044.wav|EN-default|EN|though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted.

data/example/wavs/3046.wav|EN-default|EN|It is a little cold for the time of the year.
data/example/wavs/3047.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
data/example/wavs/3048.wav|EN-default|EN|I sent the housemaid for the police.

data/example/wavs/3051.wav|EN-default|EN|You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.

data/example/wavs/3056.wav|EN-default|EN|That is the only drawback which we have found to her.
data/example/wavs/3057.wav|EN-default|EN|with a slight tremor of his extended hand,
data/example/wavs/3058.wav|EN-default|EN|Besides, it is not I alone.
data/example/wavs/3059.wav|EN-default|EN|Though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened,
data/example/wavs/3060.wav|EN-default|EN|and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north
data/example/wavs/3061.wav|EN-default|EN|believing her to be with the company.
data/example/wavs/3062.wav|EN-default|EN|There was no truth, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/3063.wav|EN-default|EN|I assured him that I was not offended.
data/example/wavs/3064.wav|EN-default|EN|the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear.
data/example/wavs/3065.wav|EN-default|EN|and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.
data/example/wavs/3066.wav|EN-default|EN|And I'd have done so before now if I could have got out of the cellar.
data/example/wavs/3067.wav|EN-default|EN|Where are the jewels which you have stolen?

data/example/wavs/3070.wav|EN-default|EN|and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.

data/example/wavs/3077.wav|EN-default|EN|which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly.
data/example/wavs/3078.wav|EN-default|EN|He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.
data/example/wavs/3079.wav|EN-default|EN|An ordinary man could not do it.
data/example/wavs/3080.wav|EN-default|EN|and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.
data/example/wavs/3081.wav|EN-default|EN|but they were made of frosted glass.
data/example/wavs/3082.wav|EN-default|EN|Here he comes, if I am not mistaken.
data/example/wavs/3083.wav|EN-default|EN|The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
data/example/wavs/3084.wav|EN-default|EN|The only point which I could not quite understand was—

data/example/wavs/3113.wav|EN-default|EN|Your experience has been a most entertaining one.
data/example/wavs/3114.wav|EN-default|EN|You are the very man which I have longed to meet.
data/example/wavs/3115.wav|EN-default|EN|amid the action and reaction of so
data/example/wavs/3116.wav|EN-default|EN|and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
data/example/wavs/3117.wav|EN-default|EN|I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor.
data/example/wavs/3118.wav|EN-default|EN|and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.
data/example/wavs/3119.wav|EN-default|EN|too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress
data/example/wavs/3120.wav|EN-default|EN|he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him.
data/example/wavs/3121.wav|EN-default|EN|and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel.
data/example/wavs/3122.wav|EN-default|EN|will not take me long to describe it.
data/example/wavs/3123.wav|EN-default|EN|I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.

data/example/wavs/3143.wav|EN-default|EN|Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him.
data/example/wavs/3144.wav|EN-default|EN|I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should.
data/example/wavs/3145.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I shall call upon you in a day.
data/example/wavs/3146.wav|EN-default|EN|but only gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
data/example/wavs/3147.wav|EN-default|EN|It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening.
data/example/wavs/3148.wav|EN-default|EN|and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/3149.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct.
data/example/wavs/3150.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age.
data/example/wavs/3151.wav|EN-default|EN|but there was no answering smile in Holmes's thin, eager face.

data/example/wavs/3153.wav|EN-default|EN|And yet there was but one woman to him.
data/example/wavs/3154.wav|EN-default|EN|his bare ankles protruding beneath,
data/example/wavs/3155.wav|EN-default|EN|At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
data/example/wavs/3156.wav|EN-default|EN|while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes
data/example/wavs/3157.wav|EN-default|EN|He never got tallow stains from a gas jet.
data/example/wavs/3158.wav|EN-default|EN|It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide.
data/example/wavs/3159.wav|EN-default|EN|I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas,
data/example/wavs/3160.wav|EN-default|EN|in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi
data/example/wavs/3161.wav|EN-default|EN|and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmore,
data/example/wavs/3162.wav|EN-default|EN|herself the very soul of delicacy.
data/example/wavs/3163.wav|EN-default|EN|and something on very much the same lines at munich
data/example/wavs/3164.wav|EN-default|EN|and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door.
data/example/wavs/3165.wav|EN-default|EN|Then we have stopped all the holes.
data/example/wavs/3166.wav|EN-default|EN|A very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaws.
data/example/wavs/3167.wav|EN-default|EN|In a few minutes I had written my note.
data/example/wavs/3168.wav|EN-default|EN|These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs,
data/example/wavs/3169.wav|EN-default|EN|But if I am to go, I must pack it once, for I have only half an hour.
data/example/wavs/3170.wav|EN-default|EN|and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again.
data/example/wavs/3171.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, no, it is in the house.
data/example/wavs/3172.wav|EN-default|EN|blown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a gale.
data/example/wavs/3173.wav|EN-default|EN|There was a movement and an exclamation from my right.
data/example/wavs/3174.wav|EN-default|EN|and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.
data/example/wavs/3175.wav|EN-default|EN|but he was glad, I think, to see me.
data/example/wavs/3176.wav|EN-default|EN|and all went as well as possible with us until the January of 85.
data/example/wavs/3177.wav|EN-default|EN|and shall probably return to London by the evening train.
data/example/wavs/3178.wav|EN-default|EN|with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy,
data/example/wavs/3179.wav|EN-default|EN|where more stress is laid, perhaps,
data/example/wavs/3180.wav|EN-default|EN|thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,
data/example/wavs/3181.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.
data/example/wavs/3182.wav|EN-default|EN|He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.
data/example/wavs/3183.wav|EN-default|EN|Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.
data/example/wavs/3184.wav|EN-default|EN|I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing.
data/example/wavs/3185.wav|EN-default|EN|and vouching for things of which i knew nothing,
data/example/wavs/3186.wav|EN-default|EN|He said that he had never heard of any such body.
data/example/wavs/3187.wav|EN-default|EN|As I have reason to believe, however,
data/example/wavs/3188.wav|EN-default|EN|who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul.
data/example/wavs/3189.wav|EN-default|EN|through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
data/example/wavs/3190.wav|EN-default|EN|and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with

data/example/wavs/3192.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot see that there is anything very funny.
data/example/wavs/3193.wav|EN-default|EN|Residing alone in lodgings in London
data/example/wavs/3194.wav|EN-default|EN|I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.
data/example/wavs/3195.wav|EN-default|EN|The other was his singular dying reference to a rat.
data/example/wavs/3196.wav|EN-default|EN|and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
data/example/wavs/3197.wav|EN-default|EN|it is perhaps the best possible solution.
data/example/wavs/3198.wav|EN-default|EN|He used to make merry over the cleverness of woman.
data/example/wavs/3199.wav|EN-default|EN|Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing—'

data/example/wavs/3204.wav|EN-default|EN|as upon our increasing our connection
data/example/wavs/3205.wav|EN-default|EN|and though we shall take them at a disadvantage,
data/example/wavs/3206.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
data/example/wavs/3207.wav|EN-default|EN|and she endeavoured to push her way in.

data/example/wavs/3209.wav|EN-default|EN|and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers,
data/example/wavs/3210.wav|EN-default|EN|where by his professional skill and his force of character

data/example/wavs/3212.wav|EN-default|EN|that I am tempted to give some account of it.
data/example/wavs/3213.wav|EN-default|EN|for he is only five years and two months older than myself.
data/example/wavs/3214.wav|EN-default|EN|Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red,
data/example/wavs/3215.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been waiting so eagerly for you.
data/example/wavs/3216.wav|EN-default|EN|That is clear and concise.
data/example/wavs/3217.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/3218.wav|EN-default|EN|my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment,
data/example/wavs/3219.wav|EN-default|EN|glancing from one to the other of us,
data/example/wavs/3220.wav|EN-default|EN|I had been warned against you months ago.
data/example/wavs/3221.wav|EN-default|EN|followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
data/example/wavs/3222.wav|EN-default|EN|I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features, that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave.
data/example/wavs/3223.wav|EN-default|EN|because she had spent so short a time in this country,
data/example/wavs/3224.wav|EN-default|EN|There is one point which I should wish to determine.
data/example/wavs/3225.wav|EN-default|EN|Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet.
data/example/wavs/3226.wav|EN-default|EN|He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London.'
data/example/wavs/3227.wav|EN-default|EN|Pity that she was not on my level.
data/example/wavs/3228.wav|EN-default|EN|and occasionally even persuaded him to forego his bohemian habits.
data/example/wavs/3229.wav|EN-default|EN|my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
data/example/wavs/3230.wav|EN-default|EN|Dr. Grimsby Roylett's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,
data/example/wavs/3231.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary,
data/example/wavs/3232.wav|EN-default|EN|I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it.
data/example/wavs/3233.wav|EN-default|EN|and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me.
data/example/wavs/3234.wav|EN-default|EN|It was in March, 1883.
data/example/wavs/3235.wav|EN-default|EN|when I looked out of my window and saw
data/example/wavs/3236.wav|EN-default|EN|Who are you, then? What do you want?
data/example/wavs/3237.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right.
data/example/wavs/3238.wav|EN-default|EN|have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it.
data/example/wavs/3239.wav|EN-default|EN|by telling us where the burls are
data/example/wavs/3240.wav|EN-default|EN|with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him.
data/example/wavs/3241.wav|EN-default|EN|If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago,
data/example/wavs/3242.wav|EN-default|EN|it is necessary that the reasoners should be able to

data/example/wavs/3244.wav|EN-default|EN|into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking.
data/example/wavs/3245.wav|EN-default|EN|and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal
data/example/wavs/3246.wav|EN-default|EN|where the security is unimpeachable.
data/example/wavs/3247.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him.
data/example/wavs/3248.wav|EN-default|EN|pressing need for repairs at that end-wall.
data/example/wavs/3249.wav|EN-default|EN|and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.
data/example/wavs/3250.wav|EN-default|EN|You must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady.
data/example/wavs/3251.wav|EN-default|EN|which ended in a very massive iron gate.
data/example/wavs/3252.wav|EN-default|EN|could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father
data/example/wavs/3253.wav|EN-default|EN|He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant.
data/example/wavs/3254.wav|EN-default|EN|We are fatty people, you know.
data/example/wavs/3255.wav|EN-default|EN|as he turned his face half round to the company once more,
data/example/wavs/3256.wav|EN-default|EN|Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room
data/example/wavs/3257.wav|EN-default|EN|and the ominous blood-stains upon the sill
data/example/wavs/3258.wav|EN-default|EN|and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.
data/example/wavs/3259.wav|EN-default|EN|and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol.
data/example/wavs/3260.wav|EN-default|EN|but the facts must be met speciously enough.
data/example/wavs/3261.wav|EN-default|EN|and inquire whether the place was still open.
data/example/wavs/3262.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Windebank did not wish us to go.
data/example/wavs/3263.wav|EN-default|EN|in which you have made an appointment with me for six o'clock.
data/example/wavs/3264.wav|EN-default|EN|And, of course, we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.
data/example/wavs/3265.wav|EN-default|EN|I may have to go down to Horsham after all.
data/example/wavs/3266.wav|EN-default|EN|I was already a dying and desperate man.
data/example/wavs/3267.wav|EN-default|EN|There was never any mystery in the matter.
data/example/wavs/3268.wav|EN-default|EN|I'll take you round to him myself.
data/example/wavs/3269.wav|EN-default|EN|pending the alterations as I understand.
data/example/wavs/3270.wav|EN-default|EN|I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions.
data/example/wavs/3271.wav|EN-default|EN|and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,
data/example/wavs/3272.wav|EN-default|EN|and in this season you shave by the sunlight.
data/example/wavs/3273.wav|EN-default|EN|into a huge vault or cellar.
data/example/wavs/3274.wav|EN-default|EN|for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
data/example/wavs/3275.wav|EN-default|EN|You shall learn nothing from me.
data/example/wavs/3276.wav|EN-default|EN|You are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.
data/example/wavs/3277.wav|EN-default|EN|just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland
data/example/wavs/3278.wav|EN-default|EN|and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
data/example/wavs/3279.wav|EN-default|EN|Your statement is, I foresee,
data/example/wavs/3280.wav|EN-default|EN|that I should call you and give you the chance.
data/example/wavs/3281.wav|EN-default|EN|should it prove to be an interesting case,
data/example/wavs/3282.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought that she had not recognized me.
data/example/wavs/3283.wav|EN-default|EN|Now let us consider the situation
data/example/wavs/3284.wav|EN-default|EN|the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.
data/example/wavs/3285.wav|EN-default|EN|or feigned indignation at it.
data/example/wavs/3286.wav|EN-default|EN|that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.
data/example/wavs/3287.wav|EN-default|EN|placed in so unprecedented a position.
data/example/wavs/3288.wav|EN-default|EN|when you drove home after the concert
data/example/wavs/3289.wav|EN-default|EN|My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly.
data/example/wavs/3290.wav|EN-default|EN|A trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.
data/example/wavs/3291.wav|EN-default|EN|and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high-road
data/example/wavs/3292.wav|EN-default|EN|Just look up the trains in Bradshaw.
data/example/wavs/3293.wav|EN-default|EN|It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted today.
data/example/wavs/3294.wav|EN-default|EN|Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp.
data/example/wavs/3295.wav|EN-default|EN|to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat,
data/example/wavs/3296.wav|EN-default|EN|and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well.
data/example/wavs/3297.wav|EN-default|EN|hastily closing the door of his safe.
data/example/wavs/3298.wav|EN-default|EN|That, however, was out of the question.
data/example/wavs/3299.wav|EN-default|EN|where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
data/example/wavs/3300.wav|EN-default|EN|At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death.
data/example/wavs/3301.wav|EN-default|EN|that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair,
data/example/wavs/3302.wav|EN-default|EN|I will tell you the true solution of the matter.
data/example/wavs/3303.wav|EN-default|EN|It's a fine law-abiding country is England.
data/example/wavs/3304.wav|EN-default|EN|and I wrote to the man himself at his business address,
data/example/wavs/3305.wav|EN-default|EN|A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.
data/example/wavs/3306.wav|EN-default|EN|put on a large blue dressing-gown,
data/example/wavs/3307.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw where Boots had faced round.
data/example/wavs/3308.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease
data/example/wavs/3309.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.
data/example/wavs/3310.wav|EN-default|EN|They were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.
data/example/wavs/3311.wav|EN-default|EN|He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,

data/example/wavs/3315.wav|EN-default|EN|He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes.

data/example/wavs/3317.wav|EN-default|EN|which, by the way, is rather a trite one.
data/example/wavs/3318.wav|EN-default|EN|ready to flash out at a moment's notice.
data/example/wavs/3319.wav|EN-default|EN|You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.
data/example/wavs/3320.wav|EN-default|EN|Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?
data/example/wavs/3321.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out.
data/example/wavs/3322.wav|EN-default|EN|and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
data/example/wavs/3323.wav|EN-default|EN|the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented
data/example/wavs/3324.wav|EN-default|EN|I do not encourage visitors.
data/example/wavs/3325.wav|EN-default|EN|but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths,
data/example/wavs/3326.wav|EN-default|EN|continued my companion imperturbably,
data/example/wavs/3327.wav|EN-default|EN|I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
data/example/wavs/3328.wav|EN-default|EN|although I am a man whose character has never yet been

data/example/wavs/3330.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, we could easily give you a shakedown.
data/example/wavs/3331.wav|EN-default|EN|Had he observed a carriage the night before, waiting for me?
data/example/wavs/3332.wav|EN-default|EN|And in practice again, I observe.
data/example/wavs/3333.wav|EN-default|EN|cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
data/example/wavs/3334.wav|EN-default|EN|i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted
data/example/wavs/3335.wav|EN-default|EN|How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately?
data/example/wavs/3336.wav|EN-default|EN|the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
data/example/wavs/3337.wav|EN-default|EN|but this time I was set on going.
data/example/wavs/3338.wav|EN-default|EN|I am much indebted to you, sir.
data/example/wavs/3339.wav|EN-default|EN|county coroner asked me at the inquiry.
data/example/wavs/3340.wav|EN-default|EN|Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.
data/example/wavs/3341.wav|EN-default|EN|he relapsed into a moody silence which was not

data/example/wavs/3343.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you think it points to suicide?
data/example/wavs/3344.wav|EN-default|EN|and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs.
data/example/wavs/3345.wav|EN-default|EN|but I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard
data/example/wavs/3346.wav|EN-default|EN|The singular incident made, as you may think,

data/example/wavs/3348.wav|EN-default|EN|appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind.
data/example/wavs/3349.wav|EN-default|EN|if I can be of any assistance.
data/example/wavs/3350.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, it could be as well.
data/example/wavs/3351.wav|EN-default|EN|The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward.
data/example/wavs/3352.wav|EN-default|EN|This beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off.

data/example/wavs/3357.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
data/example/wavs/3358.wav|EN-default|EN|Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?'
data/example/wavs/3359.wav|EN-default|EN|It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies
data/example/wavs/3360.wav|EN-default|EN|We were seated at breakfast one morning.
data/example/wavs/3361.wav|EN-default|EN|but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady,

data/example/wavs/3365.wav|EN-default|EN|He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week.
data/example/wavs/3366.wav|EN-default|EN|He walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
data/example/wavs/3367.wav|EN-default|EN|A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/3368.wav|EN-default|EN|you shall know all about the machine.
data/example/wavs/3369.wav|EN-default|EN|Pray continue your very interesting statement.
data/example/wavs/3370.wav|EN-default|EN|The central portion was in little better repair.
data/example/wavs/3371.wav|EN-default|EN|Good has come out of evil, however.
data/example/wavs/3372.wav|EN-default|EN|as had been there when I arrived.

data/example/wavs/3378.wav|EN-default|EN|The inspector and two men accompanied her back.

data/example/wavs/3380.wav|EN-default|EN|McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon,
data/example/wavs/3381.wav|EN-default|EN|He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.

data/example/wavs/3383.wav|EN-default|EN|It's worth quite a little fortune to any man that gets it.
data/example/wavs/3384.wav|EN-default|EN|Why did you beat the pavement?
data/example/wavs/3385.wav|EN-default|EN|Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street,
data/example/wavs/3386.wav|EN-default|EN|In this I was asked to sit.
data/example/wavs/3387.wav|EN-default|EN|The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb
data/example/wavs/3388.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot recall any which presented more singular features.

data/example/wavs/3392.wav|EN-default|EN|Some little time ago I bought a small place.
data/example/wavs/3393.wav|EN-default|EN|But I can't say what turn things are going to take.

data/example/wavs/3404.wav|EN-default|EN|He mumbled several words, you understand.
data/example/wavs/3405.wav|EN-default|EN|In spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.
data/example/wavs/3406.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.
data/example/wavs/3407.wav|EN-default|EN|then you may entirely rely on me.
data/example/wavs/3408.wav|EN-default|EN|And what do you think of it all, Watson?
data/example/wavs/3409.wav|EN-default|EN|You have a maid who has a sweetheart.
data/example/wavs/3410.wav|EN-default|EN|between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
data/example/wavs/3411.wav|EN-default|EN|that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself.
data/example/wavs/3412.wav|EN-default|EN|Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year.
data/example/wavs/3413.wav|EN-default|EN|so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived
data/example/wavs/3414.wav|EN-default|EN|and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet,
data/example/wavs/3415.wav|EN-default|EN|Then comes our expedition of today.
data/example/wavs/3416.wav|EN-default|EN|and all was dark in the direction of the manor-house.
data/example/wavs/3417.wav|EN-default|EN|Nothing was left save a few acres of ground.
data/example/wavs/3418.wav|EN-default|EN|for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you?

data/example/wavs/3423.wav|EN-default|EN|I assure you that your little problem
data/example/wavs/3424.wav|EN-default|EN|had been concerned in some such matter before.
data/example/wavs/3425.wav|EN-default|EN|which will probably result in his speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
data/example/wavs/3426.wav|EN-default|EN|Presently she emerged from the room again.
data/example/wavs/3427.wav|EN-default|EN|as it seems to me that our locust standee now is rather a questionable one.

data/example/wavs/3429.wav|EN-default|EN|That is undoubtedly my hat.

data/example/wavs/3440.wav|EN-default|EN|The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.

data/example/wavs/3447.wav|EN-default|EN|and i have some business to do which will take some hours.
data/example/wavs/3448.wav|EN-default|EN|My marriage had drifted us away from each other.

data/example/wavs/3450.wav|EN-default|EN|Pray be precise as to detail.
data/example/wavs/3451.wav|EN-default|EN|and the matter struck me as remarkable.
data/example/wavs/3452.wav|EN-default|EN|For a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated.
data/example/wavs/3453.wav|EN-default|EN|You just read it for yourself, sir.
data/example/wavs/3454.wav|EN-default|EN|I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise,
data/example/wavs/3455.wav|EN-default|EN|folk who were in grief came to my wife like

data/example/wavs/3460.wav|EN-default|EN|Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof.
data/example/wavs/3461.wav|EN-default|EN|but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament
data/example/wavs/3462.wav|EN-default|EN|I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment.
data/example/wavs/3463.wav|EN-default|EN|for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould.
data/example/wavs/3464.wav|EN-default|EN|the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him
data/example/wavs/3465.wav|EN-default|EN|There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.
data/example/wavs/3466.wav|EN-default|EN|but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.
data/example/wavs/3467.wav|EN-default|EN|and I was at my wits' end as to what I should do.
data/example/wavs/3468.wav|EN-default|EN|Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?
data/example/wavs/3469.wav|EN-default|EN|during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/3470.wav|EN-default|EN|Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address.

data/example/wavs/3479.wav|EN-default|EN|It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross.
data/example/wavs/3480.wav|EN-default|EN|No, no, the mystery.
data/example/wavs/3481.wav|EN-default|EN|When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious.
data/example/wavs/3482.wav|EN-default|EN|It seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils.

data/example/wavs/3494.wav|EN-default|EN|and a little blonde woman stood in the opening.

data/example/wavs/3496.wav|EN-default|EN|I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me.
data/example/wavs/3497.wav|EN-default|EN|and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.
data/example/wavs/3498.wav|EN-default|EN|There is some building going on there.'
data/example/wavs/3499.wav|EN-default|EN|He said the folk were not fit for us to know.
data/example/wavs/3500.wav|EN-default|EN|I heard her voice downstairs.

data/example/wavs/3507.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes desired to be led to the courtyard,
data/example/wavs/3508.wav|EN-default|EN|that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely,

data/example/wavs/3510.wav|EN-default|EN|More than once I have surprised her in tears.
data/example/wavs/3511.wav|EN-default|EN|which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.
data/example/wavs/3512.wav|EN-default|EN|while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor,
data/example/wavs/3513.wav|EN-default|EN|She left this morning with her husband by the 515 train from Charing Cross for the Continents.
data/example/wavs/3514.wav|EN-default|EN|some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall,

data/example/wavs/3518.wav|EN-default|EN|because during the last few nights I have always...

data/example/wavs/3524.wav|EN-default|EN|It was in January, 85, that my poor father met his end.
data/example/wavs/3525.wav|EN-default|EN|I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank.

data/example/wavs/3541.wav|EN-default|EN|He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,

data/example/wavs/3546.wav|EN-default|EN|may have been trivial in themselves.
data/example/wavs/3547.wav|EN-default|EN|and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.

data/example/wavs/3553.wav|EN-default|EN|as he had stated in his evidence,
data/example/wavs/3554.wav|EN-default|EN|For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen.

data/example/wavs/3557.wav|EN-default|EN|as to the personality of the criminal.
data/example/wavs/3558.wav|EN-default|EN|but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.
data/example/wavs/3559.wav|EN-default|EN|It was dated at midnight of the preceding night.
data/example/wavs/3560.wav|EN-default|EN|I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.
data/example/wavs/3561.wav|EN-default|EN|It is fear, Mr. Holmes.

data/example/wavs/3566.wav|EN-default|EN|and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road.

data/example/wavs/3569.wav|EN-default|EN|The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's.

data/example/wavs/3571.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course I might have fled from the house.'
data/example/wavs/3572.wav|EN-default|EN|He had been out with a serving-man in the morning at Ross.
data/example/wavs/3573.wav|EN-default|EN|probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his,
data/example/wavs/3574.wav|EN-default|EN|men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street
data/example/wavs/3575.wav|EN-default|EN|to explain the necessity of my coming at midnight.
data/example/wavs/3576.wav|EN-default|EN|I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town.
data/example/wavs/3577.wav|EN-default|EN|Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped.

data/example/wavs/3579.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Jebbes Wilson started up in his chair.
data/example/wavs/3580.wav|EN-default|EN|I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply.
data/example/wavs/3581.wav|EN-default|EN|I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.
data/example/wavs/3582.wav|EN-default|EN|He's a young man, Mr. Merriweather.
data/example/wavs/3583.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, then of course I saw it all.

data/example/wavs/3591.wav|EN-default|EN|and you are impressed by their beauty.
data/example/wavs/3592.wav|EN-default|EN|This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den.
data/example/wavs/3593.wav|EN-default|EN|He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.
data/example/wavs/3594.wav|EN-default|EN|He looked surprised, and as it seemed to me,

data/example/wavs/3596.wav|EN-default|EN|deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery,

data/example/wavs/3599.wav|EN-default|EN|We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry.
data/example/wavs/3600.wav|EN-default|EN|but when I see no less than five,
data/example/wavs/3601.wav|EN-default|EN|My profession is its own reward.

data/example/wavs/3684.wav|EN-default|EN|He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandham Lane.
data/example/wavs/3685.wav|EN-default|EN|In the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink,
data/example/wavs/3686.wav|EN-default|EN|though he little knew for what purpose.
data/example/wavs/3687.wav|EN-default|EN|and I had begun to hope that his curse had passed away from the family.
data/example/wavs/3688.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran.
data/example/wavs/3689.wav|EN-default|EN|but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications.
data/example/wavs/3690.wav|EN-default|EN|I was already deeply interested in his inquiry.
data/example/wavs/3691.wav|EN-default|EN|yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension.
data/example/wavs/3692.wav|EN-default|EN|This business at Coburg Square is...
data/example/wavs/3693.wav|EN-default|EN|and he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for him.
data/example/wavs/3694.wav|EN-default|EN|My heart is lightened already, since I have confided my trouble to you.
data/example/wavs/3695.wav|EN-default|EN|and a perpetual smell of drink.
data/example/wavs/3696.wav|EN-default|EN|Now if he had borrowed my money,
data/example/wavs/3697.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a quiet little plainly furnished room.
data/example/wavs/3698.wav|EN-default|EN|He had always laughed at what he called my
data/example/wavs/3699.wav|EN-default|EN|and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
data/example/wavs/3700.wav|EN-default|EN|He took the more chivalrous view, however,
data/example/wavs/3701.wav|EN-default|EN|the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which
data/example/wavs/3702.wav|EN-default|EN|and see what may be deduced from it.
data/example/wavs/3703.wav|EN-default|EN|They are important, you understand, without doubt.
data/example/wavs/3704.wav|EN-default|EN|like a man who is in a boiling passion.
data/example/wavs/3705.wav|EN-default|EN|but the papers must be those that are destroyed.
data/example/wavs/3706.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.
data/example/wavs/3707.wav|EN-default|EN|he investigated the case with great care.
data/example/wavs/3708.wav|EN-default|EN|I held the little printed slip to the light.
data/example/wavs/3709.wav|EN-default|EN|and even Holmes's ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
data/example/wavs/3710.wav|EN-default|EN|throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe.
data/example/wavs/3711.wav|EN-default|EN|I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again.
data/example/wavs/3712.wav|EN-default|EN|much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man
data/example/wavs/3713.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is the slip, and here are four letters from him.
data/example/wavs/3714.wav|EN-default|EN|There is a train at half-past nine.
data/example/wavs/3715.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.
data/example/wavs/3716.wav|EN-default|EN|and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
data/example/wavs/3717.wav|EN-default|EN|soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
data/example/wavs/3718.wav|EN-default|EN|I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.
data/example/wavs/3719.wav|EN-default|EN|I am about to be married.
data/example/wavs/3720.wav|EN-default|EN|See that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.
data/example/wavs/3721.wav|EN-default|EN|while he wore across the upper part of his face
data/example/wavs/3722.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography,
data/example/wavs/3723.wav|EN-default|EN|I entered my consulting room and found a gentleman seated by the table.
data/example/wavs/3724.wav|EN-default|EN|The very first key fitted to perfection.
data/example/wavs/3725.wav|EN-default|EN|laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
data/example/wavs/3726.wav|EN-default|EN|you have had your revenge upon them.
data/example/wavs/3727.wav|EN-default|EN|A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner.
data/example/wavs/3728.wav|EN-default|EN|although he has now fallen upon evil days.
data/example/wavs/3729.wav|EN-default|EN|It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air.
data/example/wavs/3730.wav|EN-default|EN|but I much prefer to make it a matter of
data/example/wavs/3731.wav|EN-default|EN|and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affair.
data/example/wavs/3732.wav|EN-default|EN|we compress the earth into bricks.
data/example/wavs/3733.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.'
data/example/wavs/3734.wav|EN-default|EN|With him we drove to the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.
data/example/wavs/3735.wav|EN-default|EN|for the lonely life of an English provincial town.
data/example/wavs/3736.wav|EN-default|EN|who, it seems, made his home there.
data/example/wavs/3737.wav|EN-default|EN|You cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was.
data/example/wavs/3738.wav|EN-default|EN|I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope
data/example/wavs/3739.wav|EN-default|EN|on account of the bequest of the late

data/example/wavs/3741.wav|EN-default|EN|then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones
data/example/wavs/3742.wav|EN-default|EN|there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise and the spring
data/example/wavs/3743.wav|EN-default|EN|It had only lain there a few days.
data/example/wavs/3744.wav|EN-default|EN|although I continually visited him.
data/example/wavs/3745.wav|EN-default|EN|usually preceded by a warning,
data/example/wavs/3746.wav|EN-default|EN|which rests upon their past.
data/example/wavs/3747.wav|EN-default|EN|I will fly, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/3748.wav|EN-default|EN|She flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart.
data/example/wavs/3749.wav|EN-default|EN|The commissionaire plumped down into a chair.
data/example/wavs/3750.wav|EN-default|EN|but you shall have it all just as it occurred.
data/example/wavs/3751.wav|EN-default|EN|they seem to have been of a most interesting character.
data/example/wavs/3752.wav|EN-default|EN|that the bureau had been forced open
data/example/wavs/3753.wav|EN-default|EN|He was urging his son to marry my daughter.
data/example/wavs/3754.wav|EN-default|EN|Private affliction also is the lot of every man.
data/example/wavs/3755.wav|EN-default|EN|Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year.
data/example/wavs/3756.wav|EN-default|EN|against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door.
data/example/wavs/3757.wav|EN-default|EN|He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.
data/example/wavs/3758.wav|EN-default|EN|throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade.
data/example/wavs/3759.wav|EN-default|EN|even when she was just a baby.
data/example/wavs/3760.wav|EN-default|EN|quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury.
data/example/wavs/3761.wav|EN-default|EN|I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door.
data/example/wavs/3762.wav|EN-default|EN|to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,
data/example/wavs/3763.wav|EN-default|EN|and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.
data/example/wavs/3764.wav|EN-default|EN|that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man.
data/example/wavs/3765.wav|EN-default|EN|I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return,
data/example/wavs/3766.wav|EN-default|EN|you can hardly be open to a charge of—'
data/example/wavs/3767.wav|EN-default|EN|it was perfectly obvious from the first.
data/example/wavs/3768.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit street.
data/example/wavs/3769.wav|EN-default|EN|Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room.
data/example/wavs/3770.wav|EN-default|EN|for I had raised my voice in my anger.
data/example/wavs/3771.wav|EN-default|EN|When I came down, Mr. Rootcastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beaches.
data/example/wavs/3772.wav|EN-default|EN|for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night.
data/example/wavs/3773.wav|EN-default|EN|I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton road,
data/example/wavs/3774.wav|EN-default|EN|means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to,
data/example/wavs/3775.wav|EN-default|EN|ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress.
data/example/wavs/3776.wav|EN-default|EN|and then I heard of him from New Mexico.
data/example/wavs/3777.wav|EN-default|EN|But then when I found how I had betrayed myself,
data/example/wavs/3778.wav|EN-default|EN|We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years.
data/example/wavs/3779.wav|EN-default|EN|The second is to clear up the mystery and to
data/example/wavs/3780.wav|EN-default|EN|he saw her stealthily open the window and open the door.
data/example/wavs/3781.wav|EN-default|EN|a small wooden shelf full of books,
data/example/wavs/3782.wav|EN-default|EN|The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
data/example/wavs/3783.wav|EN-default|EN|The road is an important highway,
data/example/wavs/3784.wav|EN-default|EN|and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.
data/example/wavs/3785.wav|EN-default|EN|with here and there a dark lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer.
data/example/wavs/3786.wav|EN-default|EN|James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister.
data/example/wavs/3787.wav|EN-default|EN|ready to turn my hand at anything.
data/example/wavs/3788.wav|EN-default|EN|proceeded to the company's office
data/example/wavs/3789.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat.
data/example/wavs/3790.wav|EN-default|EN|The lining had been of red silk,
data/example/wavs/3791.wav|EN-default|EN|I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was,
data/example/wavs/3792.wav|EN-default|EN|But what has happened since gives a meaning to it.
data/example/wavs/3793.wav|EN-default|EN|I expected them to come tonight.
data/example/wavs/3794.wav|EN-default|EN|She read the whole story, and with a scream.
data/example/wavs/3795.wav|EN-default|EN|If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.
data/example/wavs/3796.wav|EN-default|EN|As it emerged into the moonshine, I saw what it was.
data/example/wavs/3797.wav|EN-default|EN|descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement.
data/example/wavs/3798.wav|EN-default|EN|Allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton.
data/example/wavs/3799.wav|EN-default|EN|Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away,
data/example/wavs/3800.wav|EN-default|EN|he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder.
data/example/wavs/3801.wav|EN-default|EN|he denied strenuously, having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair,
data/example/wavs/3802.wav|EN-default|EN|remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us.
data/example/wavs/3803.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards.
data/example/wavs/3804.wav|EN-default|EN|That cry raised the sleepers from their beds.
data/example/wavs/3805.wav|EN-default|EN|but the lines of villas on either side were as silent
data/example/wavs/3806.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought it was his ghost at first.
data/example/wavs/3807.wav|EN-default|EN|and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.
data/example/wavs/3808.wav|EN-default|EN|by means which he is quite incapable of employing.
data/example/wavs/3809.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that I recognise the symptoms.
data/example/wavs/3810.wav|EN-default|EN|then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
data/example/wavs/3811.wav|EN-default|EN|in a tone as though asking a question.
data/example/wavs/3812.wav|EN-default|EN|droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
data/example/wavs/3813.wav|EN-default|EN|to make me even less so than usual.
data/example/wavs/3814.wav|EN-default|EN|It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
data/example/wavs/3815.wav|EN-default|EN|which he had laid down upon my books.
data/example/wavs/3816.wav|EN-default|EN|indirectly it may be of value you know.
data/example/wavs/3817.wav|EN-default|EN|This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windebank.
data/example/wavs/3818.wav|EN-default|EN|The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree.
data/example/wavs/3819.wav|EN-default|EN|I signed the paper as directed,
data/example/wavs/3820.wav|EN-default|EN|He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.
data/example/wavs/3821.wav|EN-default|EN|and was even fonder of him than I was.
data/example/wavs/3822.wav|EN-default|EN|It has been a long time in the acting.
data/example/wavs/3823.wav|EN-default|EN|No legal papers or certificates.
data/example/wavs/3824.wav|EN-default|EN|The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
data/example/wavs/3825.wav|EN-default|EN|Do not trouble about my feelings.
data/example/wavs/3826.wav|EN-default|EN|I have no doubt that I am myself to blame.
data/example/wavs/3827.wav|EN-default|EN|and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year,
data/example/wavs/3828.wav|EN-default|EN|said my wife, looking across at me.
data/example/wavs/3829.wav|EN-default|EN|is very anxious that you should come.
data/example/wavs/3830.wav|EN-default|EN|he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you.
data/example/wavs/3831.wav|EN-default|EN|about five feet seven inches in height,
data/example/wavs/3832.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he
data/example/wavs/3833.wav|EN-default|EN|and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter.
data/example/wavs/3834.wav|EN-default|EN|how is she to prove their authenticity?
data/example/wavs/3835.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew you, you scoundrel!
data/example/wavs/3836.wav|EN-default|EN|with that he sees my hair in both his hands,
data/example/wavs/3837.wav|EN-default|EN|All the afternoon he sat in the stalls, wrapped
data/example/wavs/3838.wav|EN-default|EN|and who may have heard Uncle's remarks about the coronet.
data/example/wavs/3839.wav|EN-default|EN|The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark,
data/example/wavs/3840.wav|EN-default|EN|Two handsomes were standing at the door.
data/example/wavs/3841.wav|EN-default|EN|with all its advantages and all its disadvantages,
data/example/wavs/3842.wav|EN-default|EN|Moonshine is a brighter thing than fog.
data/example/wavs/3843.wav|EN-default|EN|suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
data/example/wavs/3844.wav|EN-default|EN|and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
data/example/wavs/3845.wav|EN-default|EN|I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success.
data/example/wavs/3846.wav|EN-default|EN|Here on this page are the country folk
data/example/wavs/3847.wav|EN-default|EN|than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth,
data/example/wavs/3848.wav|EN-default|EN|and finally that she was visited
data/example/wavs/3849.wav|EN-default|EN|I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver,
data/example/wavs/3850.wav|EN-default|EN|An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
data/example/wavs/3851.wav|EN-default|EN|All shall be forgiven and forgotten.
data/example/wavs/3852.wav|EN-default|EN|Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
data/example/wavs/3853.wav|EN-default|EN|I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes.
data/example/wavs/3854.wav|EN-default|EN|and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees
data/example/wavs/3855.wav|EN-default|EN|a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes,
data/example/wavs/3856.wav|EN-default|EN|deeply attracted by the study of crime.
data/example/wavs/3857.wav|EN-default|EN|I have a small pawnbroker's business.
data/example/wavs/3858.wav|EN-default|EN|and I assure you that they were identical.
data/example/wavs/3859.wav|EN-default|EN|as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes.
data/example/wavs/3860.wav|EN-default|EN|I could distinguish the outline of an instep
data/example/wavs/3861.wav|EN-default|EN|with grizzled hair and whiskers,
data/example/wavs/3862.wav|EN-default|EN|and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table.
data/example/wavs/3863.wav|EN-default|EN|and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
data/example/wavs/3864.wav|EN-default|EN|caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house,
data/example/wavs/3865.wav|EN-default|EN|She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs.
data/example/wavs/3866.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/3867.wav|EN-default|EN|and we listened in silence to the strange story.
data/example/wavs/3868.wav|EN-default|EN|but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was
data/example/wavs/3869.wav|EN-default|EN|but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest,
data/example/wavs/3870.wav|EN-default|EN|as he had done to a hundred before her.
data/example/wavs/3871.wav|EN-default|EN|but that didn't make no change in her young man.
data/example/wavs/3872.wav|EN-default|EN|I know also that they were all three away from the ship last night.
data/example/wavs/3873.wav|EN-default|EN|to satisfy my own curiosity.
data/example/wavs/3874.wav|EN-default|EN|You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar.

data/example/wavs/3878.wav|EN-default|EN|Two months ago the Colonel received an appointment at Halifax.
data/example/wavs/3879.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel.
data/example/wavs/3880.wav|EN-default|EN|and a shock of very red hair.
data/example/wavs/3881.wav|EN-default|EN|it may have an influence upon—
data/example/wavs/3882.wav|EN-default|EN|though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
data/example/wavs/3883.wav|EN-default|EN|Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard,
data/example/wavs/3884.wav|EN-default|EN|I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and should you have any other engagement at that time, I will call at five o'clock.
data/example/wavs/3885.wav|EN-default|EN|It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.

data/example/wavs/3888.wav|EN-default|EN|all over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,
data/example/wavs/3889.wav|EN-default|EN|and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's remarriage.
data/example/wavs/3890.wav|EN-default|EN|It was something terrible and deadly.
data/example/wavs/3891.wav|EN-default|EN|He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.
data/example/wavs/3892.wav|EN-default|EN|What a woman! Oh, what a woman!
data/example/wavs/3893.wav|EN-default|EN|I keep it only to safeguard myself.
data/example/wavs/3894.wav|EN-default|EN|because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be
data/example/wavs/3895.wav|EN-default|EN|said Mr. Merriweather, as we followed them from the cellar.
data/example/wavs/3896.wav|EN-default|EN|It is peculiarly strong and stiff.
data/example/wavs/3897.wav|EN-default|EN|You seem to have done the thing very completely.
data/example/wavs/3898.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner.
data/example/wavs/3899.wav|EN-default|EN|had some very strong reason for leaving America.
data/example/wavs/3900.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor.
data/example/wavs/3901.wav|EN-default|EN|was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner.
data/example/wavs/3902.wav|EN-default|EN|I am a dying man.
data/example/wavs/3903.wav|EN-default|EN|and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly.
data/example/wavs/3904.wav|EN-default|EN|he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace,
data/example/wavs/3905.wav|EN-default|EN|Then suddenly another sound became audible.
data/example/wavs/3906.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn,
data/example/wavs/3907.wav|EN-default|EN|behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.
data/example/wavs/3908.wav|EN-default|EN|there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock,

data/example/wavs/3913.wav|EN-default|EN|He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room,

data/example/wavs/4172.wav|EN-default|EN|and finally with a woman's quick intuition,
data/example/wavs/4173.wav|EN-default|EN|for I very much prefer having a witness.
data/example/wavs/4174.wav|EN-default|EN|and as I had still much to pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
data/example/wavs/4175.wav|EN-default|EN|I ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready.
data/example/wavs/4176.wav|EN-default|EN|which tend to make the matter even more terrible.

data/example/wavs/4229.wav|EN-default|EN|I seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire.

data/example/wavs/4231.wav|EN-default|EN|He said that you could solve anything.
data/example/wavs/4232.wav|EN-default|EN|as Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair,

data/example/wavs/4291.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes had brought up a long thin cane,

data/example/wavs/4293.wav|EN-default|EN|when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beaches.

data/example/wavs/4301.wav|EN-default|EN|And did you observe any change in her then?
data/example/wavs/4302.wav|EN-default|EN|i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine
data/example/wavs/4303.wav|EN-default|EN|What was he doing there at all?
data/example/wavs/4304.wav|EN-default|EN|and then to the church of St. Monica in the Edgware Road.
data/example/wavs/4305.wav|EN-default|EN|Finally I went to the landlord

data/example/wavs/4330.wav|EN-default|EN|With a short greeting he seated himself, and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
data/example/wavs/4331.wav|EN-default|EN|I am to do it in the name of the firm

data/example/wavs/4350.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
data/example/wavs/4351.wav|EN-default|EN|that there is a field for the observation
data/example/wavs/4352.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had

data/example/wavs/4357.wav|EN-default|EN|There are several people in the neighborhood, however, who are not in the neighborhood.
data/example/wavs/4358.wav|EN-default|EN|I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rewcastle that she could do nothing with him.
data/example/wavs/4359.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too?
data/example/wavs/4360.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw the man too, in the gloom.

data/example/wavs/4362.wav|EN-default|EN|Heaven forgive me for that last sentence.

data/example/wavs/4401.wav|EN-default|EN|We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn.
data/example/wavs/4402.wav|EN-default|EN|You may set your mind at rest about that.
data/example/wavs/4403.wav|EN-default|EN|She lives quietly, sings it,
data/example/wavs/4404.wav|EN-default|EN|and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands
data/example/wavs/4405.wav|EN-default|EN|I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker.
data/example/wavs/4406.wav|EN-default|EN|and his features as inscrutable as ever.
data/example/wavs/4407.wav|EN-default|EN|which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book.
data/example/wavs/4408.wav|EN-default|EN|There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor.
data/example/wavs/4409.wav|EN-default|EN|The furniture was scattered about in every direction.
data/example/wavs/4410.wav|EN-default|EN|I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.
data/example/wavs/4411.wav|EN-default|EN|We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night.'
data/example/wavs/4412.wav|EN-default|EN|went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house,
data/example/wavs/4413.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Rucastle told me in private
data/example/wavs/4414.wav|EN-default|EN|was to introduce a distracting factor.
data/example/wavs/4415.wav|EN-default|EN|I found Holmes an animated conversation with two men.
data/example/wavs/4416.wav|EN-default|EN|You knew that this man Horner, the plumber—'
data/example/wavs/4417.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him.
data/example/wavs/4418.wav|EN-default|EN|but each time the influence of his friend
data/example/wavs/4419.wav|EN-default|EN|We will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
data/example/wavs/4420.wav|EN-default|EN|in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.
data/example/wavs/4421.wav|EN-default|EN|and the incident of the vanishing cloth.
data/example/wavs/4422.wav|EN-default|EN|Are they not fresh and beautiful?
data/example/wavs/4423.wav|EN-default|EN|His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase.
data/example/wavs/4424.wav|EN-default|EN|The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
data/example/wavs/4425.wav|EN-default|EN|Where does that bell communicate with?
data/example/wavs/4426.wav|EN-default|EN|He continued, glancing out of the window.
data/example/wavs/4427.wav|EN-default|EN|daring than any effort of the imagination,
data/example/wavs/4428.wav|EN-default|EN|I was keenly on my guard against him.
data/example/wavs/4429.wav|EN-default|EN|second son of the Duke of Balmoral.
data/example/wavs/4430.wav|EN-default|EN|tell you how quick and resolute she was.
data/example/wavs/4431.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew that it was my sister's voice.
data/example/wavs/4432.wav|EN-default|EN|to Mr. Neville St. Clair of Leigh in the County of Kent.
data/example/wavs/4433.wav|EN-default|EN|The letter arrived on March 10, 1883.
data/example/wavs/4434.wav|EN-default|EN|My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe
data/example/wavs/4435.wav|EN-default|EN|with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure.
data/example/wavs/4436.wav|EN-default|EN|We have come now out of mere vagueness
data/example/wavs/4437.wav|EN-default|EN|made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes.
data/example/wavs/4438.wav|EN-default|EN|and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal,
data/example/wavs/4439.wav|EN-default|EN|and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.
data/example/wavs/4440.wav|EN-default|EN|I was certainly surprised to find you there.
data/example/wavs/4441.wav|EN-default|EN|And we have three days yet.
data/example/wavs/4442.wav|EN-default|EN|I took my station in the business part of the city.
data/example/wavs/4443.wav|EN-default|EN|It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.
data/example/wavs/4444.wav|EN-default|EN|in the music at st james's hall
data/example/wavs/4445.wav|EN-default|EN|and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.
data/example/wavs/4446.wav|EN-default|EN|You would not object to our little whim, eh?
data/example/wavs/4447.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle?
data/example/wavs/4448.wav|EN-default|EN|it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed
data/example/wavs/4449.wav|EN-default|EN|how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
data/example/wavs/4450.wav|EN-default|EN|they often vanished before the ceremony,
data/example/wavs/4451.wav|EN-default|EN|There must be some strong reason behind.
data/example/wavs/4452.wav|EN-default|EN|We are spies in an enemy's country.
data/example/wavs/4453.wav|EN-default|EN|My last client of the sort was a king.'
data/example/wavs/4454.wav|EN-default|EN|said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity.
data/example/wavs/4455.wav|EN-default|EN|and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.
data/example/wavs/4456.wav|EN-default|EN|Then, as to money—
data/example/wavs/4457.wav|EN-default|EN|That man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him.
data/example/wavs/4458.wav|EN-default|EN|without even giving me time to thank him.
data/example/wavs/4459.wav|EN-default|EN|Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.
data/example/wavs/4460.wav|EN-default|EN|so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back.
data/example/wavs/4461.wav|EN-default|EN|makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
data/example/wavs/4462.wav|EN-default|EN|said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.
data/example/wavs/4463.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction
data/example/wavs/4464.wav|EN-default|EN|Westaway was the name of the founder of the business.
data/example/wavs/4465.wav|EN-default|EN|On glancing over my notes of the seventy-odd cases in which I have, during the last eight years, studied the methods of my friend,
data/example/wavs/4466.wav|EN-default|EN|us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them
data/example/wavs/4467.wav|EN-default|EN|And what does she propose to do with the photograph?
data/example/wavs/4468.wav|EN-default|EN|as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street,
data/example/wavs/4469.wav|EN-default|EN|Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.
data/example/wavs/4470.wav|EN-default|EN|just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.
data/example/wavs/4471.wav|EN-default|EN|Watson and I will follow in the second.
data/example/wavs/4472.wav|EN-default|EN|but without his collar or tie.
data/example/wavs/4473.wav|EN-default|EN|who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.
data/example/wavs/4474.wav|EN-default|EN|and in my stepfather's case it had
data/example/wavs/4475.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that there is good ground to think.
data/example/wavs/4476.wav|EN-default|EN|from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
data/example/wavs/4477.wav|EN-default|EN|Just hold out while I fix the derbies.
data/example/wavs/4478.wav|EN-default|EN|to prove that it had been wound up two hours before.
data/example/wavs/4479.wav|EN-default|EN|following the future career of every vessel which touched it
data/example/wavs/4480.wav|EN-default|EN|It's a common enough lash.
data/example/wavs/4481.wav|EN-default|EN|because I have both seen and observed.
data/example/wavs/4482.wav|EN-default|EN|i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend
data/example/wavs/4483.wav|EN-default|EN|it makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
data/example/wavs/4484.wav|EN-default|EN|I started from home before six.
data/example/wavs/4485.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and—
data/example/wavs/4486.wav|EN-default|EN|What was the relation between them?
data/example/wavs/4487.wav|EN-default|EN|pushing her back into the room from whence she had come,
data/example/wavs/4488.wav|EN-default|EN|So in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
data/example/wavs/4489.wav|EN-default|EN|said I, considerably astonished at his words.
data/example/wavs/4490.wav|EN-default|EN|Out of the window he must apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered
data/example/wavs/4491.wav|EN-default|EN|He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
data/example/wavs/4492.wav|EN-default|EN|where he was reported to have done very well.
data/example/wavs/4493.wav|EN-default|EN|As he spoke the door opened and a young lady,
data/example/wavs/4494.wav|EN-default|EN|to say that the description tallied in every respect
data/example/wavs/4495.wav|EN-default|EN|Your own opinion is, then, that some...
data/example/wavs/4496.wav|EN-default|EN|I have had diabetes for years.
data/example/wavs/4497.wav|EN-default|EN|said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
data/example/wavs/4498.wav|EN-default|EN|In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.
data/example/wavs/4499.wav|EN-default|EN|I regret that I have kept you waiting.
data/example/wavs/4500.wav|EN-default|EN|But what is that compared with the number of your successes?
data/example/wavs/4501.wav|EN-default|EN|Traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill.
data/example/wavs/4502.wav|EN-default|EN|And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study.
data/example/wavs/4503.wav|EN-default|EN|or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.
data/example/wavs/4504.wav|EN-default|EN|that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.
data/example/wavs/4505.wav|EN-default|EN|there was a double stream upon the stair.
data/example/wavs/4506.wav|EN-default|EN|when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the Colonel looking down at me.
data/example/wavs/4507.wav|EN-default|EN|and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.
data/example/wavs/4508.wav|EN-default|EN|I confess that I have been as blind as a mole.
data/example/wavs/4509.wav|EN-default|EN|as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks,
data/example/wavs/4510.wav|EN-default|EN|there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.
data/example/wavs/4511.wav|EN-default|EN|and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.
data/example/wavs/4512.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps you would kindly attend my thumb?
data/example/wavs/4513.wav|EN-default|EN|The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening
data/example/wavs/4514.wav|EN-default|EN|No hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty.
data/example/wavs/4515.wav|EN-default|EN|He has died within ten seconds of being bitten.
data/example/wavs/4516.wav|EN-default|EN|Have you the chisel and the bags?
data/example/wavs/4517.wav|EN-default|EN|because in other respects you would really have done very nicely.
data/example/wavs/4518.wav|EN-default|EN|with a bland, insinuating manner.
data/example/wavs/4519.wav|EN-default|EN|With these he constructed a sort of eastern divan.
data/example/wavs/4520.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, and what happened when Mr. Windebank, your stepfather, returned to France?
data/example/wavs/4521.wav|EN-default|EN|turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
data/example/wavs/4522.wav|EN-default|EN|which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body.
data/example/wavs/4523.wav|EN-default|EN|I suppose there would be no chance of a train
data/example/wavs/4524.wav|EN-default|EN|a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance,
data/example/wavs/4525.wav|EN-default|EN|founded upon all that I have heard of you.
data/example/wavs/4526.wav|EN-default|EN|and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred.
data/example/wavs/4527.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, a cheetah is just a big cat.
data/example/wavs/4528.wav|EN-default|EN|so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge,
data/example/wavs/4529.wav|EN-default|EN|Who would think that so pretty a toy
data/example/wavs/4530.wav|EN-default|EN|Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker.
data/example/wavs/4531.wav|EN-default|EN|we are but preventing her from injuring another.
data/example/wavs/4532.wav|EN-default|EN|Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
data/example/wavs/4533.wav|EN-default|EN|and found him in deep conversation with the very stout,
data/example/wavs/4534.wav|EN-default|EN|I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabin to your wife,
data/example/wavs/4535.wav|EN-default|EN|Mrs. Rewcastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.
data/example/wavs/4536.wav|EN-default|EN|And ladies' fancies, you know, madam.
data/example/wavs/4537.wav|EN-default|EN|and saw a shadow pass backward and forward,
data/example/wavs/4538.wav|EN-default|EN|because he was handy and would come cheap.
data/example/wavs/4539.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps you would not be very gracious either.
data/example/wavs/4540.wav|EN-default|EN|of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.
data/example/wavs/4541.wav|EN-default|EN|As he ran he jerked his hands up and down.
data/example/wavs/4542.wav|EN-default|EN|all we wish you to do is to examine the machine
data/example/wavs/4543.wav|EN-default|EN|How could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?
data/example/wavs/4544.wav|EN-default|EN|said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
data/example/wavs/4545.wav|EN-default|EN|whatever your reasons may be,
data/example/wavs/4546.wav|EN-default|EN|and the vein stood out like whip-cord in his long sinewy neck.
data/example/wavs/4547.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sure if I had known—
data/example/wavs/4548.wav|EN-default|EN|These are young McCarthy's feet.
data/example/wavs/4549.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. and Mrs. Reucastle were both downstairs,
data/example/wavs/4550.wav|EN-default|EN|The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure.
data/example/wavs/4551.wav|EN-default|EN|He seems a very amiable person.
data/example/wavs/4552.wav|EN-default|EN|Philosophy, astronomy and politics were marked at zero, I remember.
data/example/wavs/4553.wav|EN-default|EN|but none the less you must come round to my view.
data/example/wavs/4554.wav|EN-default|EN|but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.
data/example/wavs/4555.wav|EN-default|EN|It was quite beyond my powers to determine
data/example/wavs/4556.wav|EN-default|EN|it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight.
data/example/wavs/4557.wav|EN-default|EN|This is Mr. Jabez Wilson.
data/example/wavs/4558.wav|EN-default|EN|remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,
data/example/wavs/4559.wav|EN-default|EN|His silence appears to me to cut
data/example/wavs/4560.wav|EN-default|EN|the family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and
data/example/wavs/4561.wav|EN-default|EN|Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.
data/example/wavs/4562.wav|EN-default|EN|and perhaps I should be among the number.
data/example/wavs/4563.wav|EN-default|EN|and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation
data/example/wavs/4564.wav|EN-default|EN|He followed me to my room, however, that night, with a very
data/example/wavs/4565.wav|EN-default|EN|The firm does so when the security is good.
data/example/wavs/4566.wav|EN-default|EN|Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage-window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.
data/example/wavs/4567.wav|EN-default|EN|for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud,
data/example/wavs/4568.wav|EN-default|EN|until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
data/example/wavs/4569.wav|EN-default|EN|I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours, if he were indeed at the address which she had given me.
data/example/wavs/4570.wav|EN-default|EN|and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow.
data/example/wavs/4571.wav|EN-default|EN|a chill wind blowing in our faces,
data/example/wavs/4572.wav|EN-default|EN|so that he is always as keen as mustard.
data/example/wavs/4573.wav|EN-default|EN|something just a little funny about it.
data/example/wavs/4574.wav|EN-default|EN|She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother.
data/example/wavs/4575.wav|EN-default|EN|It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
data/example/wavs/4576.wav|EN-default|EN|and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise.
data/example/wavs/4577.wav|EN-default|EN|and excavating Fuller's earth.
data/example/wavs/4578.wav|EN-default|EN|has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.
data/example/wavs/4579.wav|EN-default|EN|that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.
data/example/wavs/4580.wav|EN-default|EN|I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. D.
data/example/wavs/4581.wav|EN-default|EN|Pondicherry in January and February in 83.
data/example/wavs/4582.wav|EN-default|EN|Its finder has carried it off, therefore,
data/example/wavs/4583.wav|EN-default|EN|Half a guinea if you do it in 20 minutes.
data/example/wavs/4584.wav|EN-default|EN|I was in time for the last train to Eiford,
data/example/wavs/4585.wav|EN-default|EN|After a time he did not come in at all.
data/example/wavs/4586.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been at work upon it all day.
data/example/wavs/4587.wav|EN-default|EN|He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator,
data/example/wavs/4588.wav|EN-default|EN|It is most important all the same.
data/example/wavs/4589.wav|EN-default|EN|and had been famous in the green room for my skill.
data/example/wavs/4590.wav|EN-default|EN|Now if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson,
data/example/wavs/4591.wav|EN-default|EN|The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner,
data/example/wavs/4592.wav|EN-default|EN|"'She is an American and came from California with her.'
data/example/wavs/4593.wav|EN-default|EN|He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage.
data/example/wavs/4594.wav|EN-default|EN|It was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
data/example/wavs/4595.wav|EN-default|EN|and then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head,
data/example/wavs/4596.wav|EN-default|EN|This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,
data/example/wavs/4597.wav|EN-default|EN|and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney.
data/example/wavs/4598.wav|EN-default|EN|his features were gravely set.
data/example/wavs/4599.wav|EN-default|EN|only as much as we can deduce.
data/example/wavs/4600.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way across the park.
data/example/wavs/4601.wav|EN-default|EN|She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.
data/example/wavs/4602.wav|EN-default|EN|and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them.
data/example/wavs/4603.wav|EN-default|EN|Ask me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft.
data/example/wavs/4604.wav|EN-default|EN|and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot,
data/example/wavs/4605.wav|EN-default|EN|where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure.
data/example/wavs/4606.wav|EN-default|EN|broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
data/example/wavs/4607.wav|EN-default|EN|Ryder instantly gave the alarm,
data/example/wavs/4608.wav|EN-default|EN|done about the same time as the bell-rope,
data/example/wavs/4609.wav|EN-default|EN|and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error
data/example/wavs/4610.wav|EN-default|EN|conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows
data/example/wavs/4611.wav|EN-default|EN|I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
data/example/wavs/4612.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair.
data/example/wavs/4613.wav|EN-default|EN|such as he had started to town in,
data/example/wavs/4614.wav|EN-default|EN|I used to be able to keep two assistants.
data/example/wavs/4615.wav|EN-default|EN|and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand.
data/example/wavs/4616.wav|EN-default|EN|And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?'
data/example/wavs/4617.wav|EN-default|EN|even on such a night, for their purpose.
data/example/wavs/4618.wav|EN-default|EN|She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.
data/example/wavs/4619.wav|EN-default|EN|Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room,
data/example/wavs/4620.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.
data/example/wavs/4621.wav|EN-default|EN|we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets,
data/example/wavs/4622.wav|EN-default|EN|and to having rushed into the room
data/example/wavs/4623.wav|EN-default|EN|and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us.
data/example/wavs/4624.wav|EN-default|EN|and the date of his supposed suicide.
data/example/wavs/4625.wav|EN-default|EN|had anything to do with the matter?
data/example/wavs/4626.wav|EN-default|EN|I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew.
data/example/wavs/4627.wav|EN-default|EN|Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch.
data/example/wavs/4628.wav|EN-default|EN|With a few grateful words to Holmes, she bade us both good-night, and bustled off upon her way.
data/example/wavs/4629.wav|EN-default|EN|so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down
data/example/wavs/4630.wav|EN-default|EN|presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture
data/example/wavs/4631.wav|EN-default|EN|I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry.
data/example/wavs/4632.wav|EN-default|EN|I can stand this strain no longer.
data/example/wavs/4633.wav|EN-default|EN|My friend rose now and paced up and down the room.
data/example/wavs/4634.wav|EN-default|EN|to return to him when he summoned.
data/example/wavs/4635.wav|EN-default|EN|But what other is there?

data/example/wavs/4640.wav|EN-default|EN|I am ashamed of you, Holmes.
data/example/wavs/4641.wav|EN-default|EN|and to make myself as pitiable as possible,
data/example/wavs/4642.wav|EN-default|EN|just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.

data/example/wavs/4675.wav|EN-default|EN|He's not been home for two days. I'm so frightened about him.
data/example/wavs/4676.wav|EN-default|EN|It was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate.
data/example/wavs/4677.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot as yet see any connection.

data/example/wavs/4689.wav|EN-default|EN|He was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.
data/example/wavs/4690.wav|EN-default|EN|Then at the gas-fitter's ball you met.

data/example/wavs/4694.wav|EN-default|EN|I hardly consider that a conclusive proof.

data/example/wavs/4697.wav|EN-default|EN|his letters were to be forwarded to

data/example/wavs/4699.wav|EN-default|EN|when I have told you that I saw Arthur with a coronet in his hands.
data/example/wavs/4700.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that the change would do you good.

data/example/wavs/4702.wav|EN-default|EN|I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/4703.wav|EN-default|EN|too much to say that it is of such weight.

data/example/wavs/4705.wav|EN-default|EN|and you will know all that there is to know.

data/example/wavs/4710.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone.
data/example/wavs/4711.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Windebank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to Mother.

data/example/wavs/4714.wav|EN-default|EN|and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.

data/example/wavs/4716.wav|EN-default|EN|The incident, however, was too trivial to relate, and

data/example/wavs/4723.wav|EN-default|EN|He held out his snuff-box of old gold.
data/example/wavs/4724.wav|EN-default|EN|but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
data/example/wavs/4725.wav|EN-default|EN|He was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross.
data/example/wavs/4726.wav|EN-default|EN|This is a very unexpected turn of affairs.
data/example/wavs/4727.wav|EN-default|EN|while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.
data/example/wavs/4728.wav|EN-default|EN|I fainted when it was done.
data/example/wavs/4729.wav|EN-default|EN|We got a knife and opened the goose.
data/example/wavs/4730.wav|EN-default|EN|He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you.

data/example/wavs/4734.wav|EN-default|EN|I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.
data/example/wavs/4735.wav|EN-default|EN|I searched the Dundee records.
data/example/wavs/4736.wav|EN-default|EN|that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.
data/example/wavs/4737.wav|EN-default|EN|How could they have decoyed him down there?
data/example/wavs/4738.wav|EN-default|EN|said the lady as we entered a well-lit
data/example/wavs/4739.wav|EN-default|EN|and which it is the object of these papers.
data/example/wavs/4740.wav|EN-default|EN|and I am ready enough to tell what I know.

data/example/wavs/4742.wav|EN-default|EN|and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house.
data/example/wavs/4743.wav|EN-default|EN|so I deduced a blunt penknife.
data/example/wavs/4744.wav|EN-default|EN|There were six troopers and six of us.

data/example/wavs/4749.wav|EN-default|EN|I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.
data/example/wavs/4750.wav|EN-default|EN|as silent as Mrs. Rewcastle,
data/example/wavs/4751.wav|EN-default|EN|Why should I put ideas in his head?"
data/example/wavs/4752.wav|EN-default|EN|even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him,
data/example/wavs/4753.wav|EN-default|EN|I came to Baker Street by the underground and hurried from there on foot.

data/example/wavs/4757.wav|EN-default|EN|and stared into the crackling fire.

data/example/wavs/4761.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that we may gain that by means of the law.
data/example/wavs/4762.wav|EN-default|EN|there was something else which she would fain have said.
data/example/wavs/4763.wav|EN-default|EN|finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble,
data/example/wavs/4764.wav|EN-default|EN|which must have belonged to the attic,

data/example/wavs/4766.wav|EN-default|EN|and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
data/example/wavs/4767.wav|EN-default|EN|made the inspector realize that the matter was serious.
data/example/wavs/4768.wav|EN-default|EN|He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked.
data/example/wavs/4769.wav|EN-default|EN|This case, I presume, contains the coronet.
data/example/wavs/4770.wav|EN-default|EN|It is also my custom, said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits,
data/example/wavs/4771.wav|EN-default|EN|something which took many hours a day.

data/example/wavs/4776.wav|EN-default|EN|And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.

data/example/wavs/4778.wav|EN-default|EN|While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events,
data/example/wavs/4779.wav|EN-default|EN|I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement.
data/example/wavs/4780.wav|EN-default|EN|who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?
data/example/wavs/4781.wav|EN-default|EN|said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
data/example/wavs/4782.wav|EN-default|EN|In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room,
data/example/wavs/4783.wav|EN-default|EN|a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage,
data/example/wavs/4784.wav|EN-default|EN|Pray, what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
data/example/wavs/4785.wav|EN-default|EN|This went on for day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in in plank
data/example/wavs/4786.wav|EN-default|EN|It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
data/example/wavs/4787.wav|EN-default|EN|inspiring pity by my ghastly face,

data/example/wavs/4789.wav|EN-default|EN|the introduction of his name will cause him to see it.
data/example/wavs/4790.wav|EN-default|EN|and let the county police know what has happened.
data/example/wavs/4791.wav|EN-default|EN|and now to have been reabsorbed by them.
data/example/wavs/4792.wav|EN-default|EN|so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
data/example/wavs/4793.wav|EN-default|EN|I told Arthur and Mary my experience.
data/example/wavs/4794.wav|EN-default|EN|showed that this was where the family resided.
data/example/wavs/4795.wav|EN-default|EN|And why did you wish to see me?
data/example/wavs/4796.wav|EN-default|EN|I find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber.
data/example/wavs/4797.wav|EN-default|EN|I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived.
data/example/wavs/4798.wav|EN-default|EN|or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp.
data/example/wavs/4799.wav|EN-default|EN|while the brass box stood open and empty beside it.
data/example/wavs/4800.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew at once by the wishing sound that there was a slight leakage.
data/example/wavs/4801.wav|EN-default|EN|Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.
data/example/wavs/4802.wav|EN-default|EN|If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.
data/example/wavs/4803.wav|EN-default|EN|My sister Julia and I were twins.

data/example/wavs/4807.wav|EN-default|EN|The initials were, of course, of the highest importance.

data/example/wavs/4809.wav|EN-default|EN|as Holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her.
data/example/wavs/4810.wav|EN-default|EN|He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping,
data/example/wavs/4811.wav|EN-default|EN|The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning.
data/example/wavs/4812.wav|EN-default|EN|and to wait you at the corner of the street.
data/example/wavs/4813.wav|EN-default|EN|He answered with a sidelong glance.
data/example/wavs/4814.wav|EN-default|EN|It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.
data/example/wavs/4815.wav|EN-default|EN|I have them in the hollow of my hand.

data/example/wavs/4818.wav|EN-default|EN|God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
data/example/wavs/4819.wav|EN-default|EN|while I take a glance as to who our client is.
data/example/wavs/4820.wav|EN-default|EN|and no harm done save the loss of a goose.
data/example/wavs/4821.wav|EN-default|EN|although they impressed me in his favour.
data/example/wavs/4822.wav|EN-default|EN|Your wife has been waiting this two days for you.
data/example/wavs/4823.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I have just time, with your assistance,
data/example/wavs/4824.wav|EN-default|EN|there is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him.
data/example/wavs/4825.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen.
data/example/wavs/4826.wav|EN-default|EN|the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb,
data/example/wavs/4827.wav|EN-default|EN|and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
data/example/wavs/4828.wav|EN-default|EN|This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements.
data/example/wavs/4829.wav|EN-default|EN|the next day, we were well upon our way to the old English capital.
data/example/wavs/4830.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this,
data/example/wavs/4831.wav|EN-default|EN|that the events occurred which I am now about to summarize.
data/example/wavs/4832.wav|EN-default|EN|the mail-boat will have carried this letter
data/example/wavs/4833.wav|EN-default|EN|for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate
data/example/wavs/4834.wav|EN-default|EN|by whom he now has two children.
data/example/wavs/4835.wav|EN-default|EN|I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
data/example/wavs/4836.wav|EN-default|EN|The boscombe pool is thickly wooded round.
data/example/wavs/4837.wav|EN-default|EN|Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black-
data/example/wavs/4838.wav|EN-default|EN|beating and splashing against the window.
data/example/wavs/4839.wav|EN-default|EN|until at last I gave it over in despair.
data/example/wavs/4840.wav|EN-default|EN|for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things
data/example/wavs/4841.wav|EN-default|EN|I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue.
data/example/wavs/4842.wav|EN-default|EN|and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.
data/example/wavs/4843.wav|EN-default|EN|Except yourself I have none.
data/example/wavs/4844.wav|EN-default|EN|The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it,

data/example/wavs/4848.wav|EN-default|EN|It's a question whether I shall live to the assizes.
data/example/wavs/4849.wav|EN-default|EN|and the paper flattened out upon his knee,
data/example/wavs/4850.wav|EN-default|EN|and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years,
data/example/wavs/4851.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my record.
data/example/wavs/4852.wav|EN-default|EN|Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it.
data/example/wavs/4853.wav|EN-default|EN|As he spoke there was a sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb.
data/example/wavs/4854.wav|EN-default|EN|and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.
data/example/wavs/4855.wav|EN-default|EN|I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow
data/example/wavs/4856.wav|EN-default|EN|It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol.
data/example/wavs/4857.wav|EN-default|EN|and as such I had influence over him.

data/example/wavs/4865.wav|EN-default|EN|Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the street.
data/example/wavs/4866.wav|EN-default|EN|remarked Holmes, stretching his long thin legs towards the fire.
data/example/wavs/4867.wav|EN-default|EN|and in spite of my ignorance of German, I could see that
data/example/wavs/4868.wav|EN-default|EN|somehow I can get nothing to go upon.
data/example/wavs/4869.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be immensely obliged to you.

data/example/wavs/5111.wav|EN-default|EN|What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
data/example/wavs/5112.wav|EN-default|EN|At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me.
data/example/wavs/5113.wav|EN-default|EN|Three times by men, and once by a woman.
data/example/wavs/5114.wav|EN-default|EN|There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months.

data/example/wavs/5117.wav|EN-default|EN|to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood,
data/example/wavs/5118.wav|EN-default|EN|because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.
data/example/wavs/5119.wav|EN-default|EN|while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand.
data/example/wavs/5120.wav|EN-default|EN|who was equally hot upon the other side.

data/example/wavs/5122.wav|EN-default|EN|sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose
data/example/wavs/5123.wav|EN-default|EN|but at that moment her knees seemed to give way,
data/example/wavs/5124.wav|EN-default|EN|but you understand that as long as I live at home
data/example/wavs/5125.wav|EN-default|EN|I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried.
data/example/wavs/5126.wav|EN-default|EN|to show me that I was not mistaken.

data/example/wavs/5128.wav|EN-default|EN|for solution during the years of our intimacy,
data/example/wavs/5129.wav|EN-default|EN|I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directorate.
data/example/wavs/5130.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a delicate part which I had to play then.
data/example/wavs/5131.wav|EN-default|EN|and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear.

data/example/wavs/5139.wav|EN-default|EN|Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him.

data/example/wavs/5141.wav|EN-default|EN|and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes,

data/example/wavs/5148.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, I don't know why not.

data/example/wavs/5150.wav|EN-default|EN|You look on these things from another standpoint.
data/example/wavs/5151.wav|EN-default|EN|and at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face,

data/example/wavs/5154.wav|EN-default|EN|A fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
data/example/wavs/5155.wav|EN-default|EN|he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes,
data/example/wavs/5156.wav|EN-default|EN|with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
data/example/wavs/5157.wav|EN-default|EN|as I was already in debt to my tradesmen,
data/example/wavs/5158.wav|EN-default|EN|he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best,

data/example/wavs/5160.wav|EN-default|EN|hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the countryside.
data/example/wavs/5161.wav|EN-default|EN|and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.
data/example/wavs/5162.wav|EN-default|EN|to be definite, in May 1884.
data/example/wavs/5163.wav|EN-default|EN|I venture to remark upon short sight in typewriting.
data/example/wavs/5164.wav|EN-default|EN|that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.
data/example/wavs/5165.wav|EN-default|EN|about four o'clock on Christmas morning,

data/example/wavs/5168.wav|EN-default|EN|while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man
data/example/wavs/5169.wav|EN-default|EN|No, but I observed the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.
data/example/wavs/5170.wav|EN-default|EN|I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.
data/example/wavs/5171.wav|EN-default|EN|and is read by Mark Smith of Simpsonville, South Carolina.
data/example/wavs/5172.wav|EN-default|EN|His defence was one of absolute ignorance.
data/example/wavs/5173.wav|EN-default|EN|and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
data/example/wavs/5174.wav|EN-default|EN|The matter is a perfectly trivial one.
data/example/wavs/5175.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
data/example/wavs/5176.wav|EN-default|EN|Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more, but—
data/example/wavs/5177.wav|EN-default|EN|There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child—'
data/example/wavs/5178.wav|EN-default|EN|to such absolute ruin that
data/example/wavs/5179.wav|EN-default|EN|which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backwards.
data/example/wavs/5180.wav|EN-default|EN|and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.
data/example/wavs/5181.wav|EN-default|EN|Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.
data/example/wavs/5182.wav|EN-default|EN|Excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.
data/example/wavs/5183.wav|EN-default|EN|It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk,
data/example/wavs/5184.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall never see them again.
data/example/wavs/5185.wav|EN-default|EN|The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply,
data/example/wavs/5186.wav|EN-default|EN|dark and sinister business.
data/example/wavs/5187.wav|EN-default|EN|I answered, glancing at the postmark.
data/example/wavs/5188.wav|EN-default|EN|No, no, nothing of the kind.
data/example/wavs/5189.wav|EN-default|EN|It is the butt-end of the gun, as the son stood listening.
data/example/wavs/5190.wav|EN-default|EN|and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve
data/example/wavs/5191.wav|EN-default|EN|but is barred up by four large staples.
data/example/wavs/5192.wav|EN-default|EN|I took the paper from him and read as follows.
data/example/wavs/5193.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door.
data/example/wavs/5194.wav|EN-default|EN|and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.
data/example/wavs/5195.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again.
data/example/wavs/5196.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot admire his taste.
data/example/wavs/5197.wav|EN-default|EN|That would suit me very well.
data/example/wavs/5198.wav|EN-default|EN|and the veins stood out at his temples with
data/example/wavs/5199.wav|EN-default|EN|You have given me fresh life and hope.
data/example/wavs/5200.wav|EN-default|EN|there is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him
data/example/wavs/5201.wav|EN-default|EN|as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years
data/example/wavs/5202.wav|EN-default|EN|Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses.
data/example/wavs/5203.wav|EN-default|EN|I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes.
data/example/wavs/5204.wav|EN-default|EN|made a careful examination of the attic.
data/example/wavs/5205.wav|EN-default|EN|really old toller, my groom,
data/example/wavs/5206.wav|EN-default|EN|which terminated at another formidable gate.
data/example/wavs/5207.wav|EN-default|EN|but it is probable that when she comes
data/example/wavs/5208.wav|EN-default|EN|My morning's work has not been wasted, since it is proved that he has the very strongest motives
data/example/wavs/5209.wav|EN-default|EN|of mysteries and improbabilities
data/example/wavs/5210.wav|EN-default|EN|though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
data/example/wavs/5211.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, when they closed their league offices,
data/example/wavs/5212.wav|EN-default|EN|What on earth can be the matter with him?
data/example/wavs/5213.wav|EN-default|EN|He broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
data/example/wavs/5214.wav|EN-default|EN|If so, it is a serious case.
data/example/wavs/5215.wav|EN-default|EN|to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/5216.wav|EN-default|EN|It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving.
data/example/wavs/5217.wav|EN-default|EN|should be in the power of such a man as this.
data/example/wavs/5218.wav|EN-default|EN|Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip.
data/example/wavs/5219.wav|EN-default|EN|for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.
data/example/wavs/5220.wav|EN-default|EN|with knitted brows and an abstracted air.
data/example/wavs/5221.wav|EN-default|EN|Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps.
data/example/wavs/5222.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is the first notice which I can find.
data/example/wavs/5223.wav|EN-default|EN|but the reason is very obvious.
data/example/wavs/5224.wav|EN-default|EN|covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses,
data/example/wavs/5225.wav|EN-default|EN|and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze,
data/example/wavs/5226.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound,
data/example/wavs/5227.wav|EN-default|EN|There were not many who had the real vivid flame-colored...
data/example/wavs/5228.wav|EN-default|EN|wondered what it would be best to do.
data/example/wavs/5229.wav|EN-default|EN|possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case.
data/example/wavs/5230.wav|EN-default|EN|and my father entered into possession of the estate,
data/example/wavs/5231.wav|EN-default|EN|Of all these varied cases, however,
data/example/wavs/5232.wav|EN-default|EN|He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door.
data/example/wavs/5233.wav|EN-default|EN|she could trust her own guardianship,
data/example/wavs/5234.wav|EN-default|EN|Dr. Boettcher is an Englishman.
data/example/wavs/5235.wav|EN-default|EN|remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.
data/example/wavs/5236.wav|EN-default|EN|You must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/5237.wav|EN-default|EN|he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime.
data/example/wavs/5238.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he walks slowly up the street.
data/example/wavs/5239.wav|EN-default|EN|It is very unlike his usual writing.
data/example/wavs/5240.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not cold which makes me shiver.
data/example/wavs/5241.wav|EN-default|EN|unraveled the problems which were submitted to him.
data/example/wavs/5242.wav|EN-default|EN|with a strong masculine face.
data/example/wavs/5243.wav|EN-default|EN|delicacy that I cannot confide it.
data/example/wavs/5244.wav|EN-default|EN|but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it,
data/example/wavs/5245.wav|EN-default|EN|You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.
data/example/wavs/5246.wav|EN-default|EN|You have no further evidence, I suppose.'
data/example/wavs/5247.wav|EN-default|EN|You have formed some conclusion?
data/example/wavs/5248.wav|EN-default|EN|and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.
data/example/wavs/5249.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been too busy to think of food.
data/example/wavs/5250.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall most certainly do so.
data/example/wavs/5251.wav|EN-default|EN|with a comical pomposity of manner, he bowed solemnly to both of us,
data/example/wavs/5252.wav|EN-default|EN|father was a plumber in the tottenham court road
data/example/wavs/5253.wav|EN-default|EN|as far as i can understand
data/example/wavs/5254.wav|EN-default|EN|Besides she is not so very young.
data/example/wavs/5255.wav|EN-default|EN|He is a man who leads a sedentary life.
data/example/wavs/5256.wav|EN-default|EN|but I sleep more heavily than you.
data/example/wavs/5257.wav|EN-default|EN|Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?
data/example/wavs/5258.wav|EN-default|EN|until we had turned down one of the quiet streets
data/example/wavs/5259.wav|EN-default|EN|of one of the principal London banks.
data/example/wavs/5260.wav|EN-default|EN|I tell you that it is Friday, man.
data/example/wavs/5261.wav|EN-default|EN|there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice.
data/example/wavs/5262.wav|EN-default|EN|and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
data/example/wavs/5263.wav|EN-default|EN|at the idea that she might have seen an American.
data/example/wavs/5264.wav|EN-default|EN|How did you deduce that this man was intellectual?
data/example/wavs/5265.wav|EN-default|EN|he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before.
data/example/wavs/5266.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar.
data/example/wavs/5267.wav|EN-default|EN|for he has frequently brought him to my house,
data/example/wavs/5268.wav|EN-default|EN|but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.
data/example/wavs/5269.wav|EN-default|EN|but he always glided away to some other topic.
data/example/wavs/5270.wav|EN-default|EN|We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed.
data/example/wavs/5271.wav|EN-default|EN|the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure,
data/example/wavs/5272.wav|EN-default|EN|He appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel.
data/example/wavs/5273.wav|EN-default|EN|As I dressed, I glanced at my watch.
data/example/wavs/5274.wav|EN-default|EN|During two years I have had three consultations and one small job.
data/example/wavs/5275.wav|EN-default|EN|I was just balancing whether I should run for it.
data/example/wavs/5276.wav|EN-default|EN|No, he was quite averse to it also.
data/example/wavs/5277.wav|EN-default|EN|In the road stood our horse and trap,
data/example/wavs/5278.wav|EN-default|EN|yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day,
data/example/wavs/5279.wav|EN-default|EN|Make notes upon anything which you might tell us.
data/example/wavs/5280.wav|EN-default|EN|and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion.
data/example/wavs/5281.wav|EN-default|EN|by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
data/example/wavs/5282.wav|EN-default|EN|Julia went there at Christmas two years ago.
data/example/wavs/5283.wav|EN-default|EN|It was lost, if I remember aright.
data/example/wavs/5284.wav|EN-default|EN|and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
data/example/wavs/5285.wav|EN-default|EN|did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion.
data/example/wavs/5286.wav|EN-default|EN|and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him.
data/example/wavs/5287.wav|EN-default|EN|he added, as the wheels of the Royal Brougham rolled down the street.
data/example/wavs/5288.wav|EN-default|EN|There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs.
data/example/wavs/5289.wav|EN-default|EN|so long that I did not disturb him in his privacy.
data/example/wavs/5290.wav|EN-default|EN|No, I know no one in these parts.
data/example/wavs/5291.wav|EN-default|EN|but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
data/example/wavs/5292.wav|EN-default|EN|I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me.
data/example/wavs/5293.wav|EN-default|EN|threw up her hands with a despairing gesture,
data/example/wavs/5294.wav|EN-default|EN|For a long time he remained there.
data/example/wavs/5295.wav|EN-default|EN|If I promise to keep a secret,
data/example/wavs/5296.wav|EN-default|EN|learned all the secrets of making up.
data/example/wavs/5297.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.
data/example/wavs/5298.wav|EN-default|EN|rather than I should marry another woman.
data/example/wavs/5299.wav|EN-default|EN|You had heard, rider, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?
data/example/wavs/5300.wav|EN-default|EN|by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag,
data/example/wavs/5301.wav|EN-default|EN|She is what we call in England a
data/example/wavs/5302.wav|EN-default|EN|Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters
data/example/wavs/5303.wav|EN-default|EN|altogether, look as I would,
data/example/wavs/5304.wav|EN-default|EN|and then i think that what he foresaw
data/example/wavs/5305.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, it is childish.
data/example/wavs/5306.wav|EN-default|EN|sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood
data/example/wavs/5307.wav|EN-default|EN|of the Amateur Mendicant Society.
data/example/wavs/5308.wav|EN-default|EN|i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor
data/example/wavs/5309.wav|EN-default|EN|but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a
data/example/wavs/5310.wav|EN-default|EN|and has always given me satisfaction.
data/example/wavs/5311.wav|EN-default|EN|But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/5312.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
data/example/wavs/5313.wav|EN-default|EN|Have they thought of looking outside the house?
data/example/wavs/5314.wav|EN-default|EN|will answer your purpose equally well?
data/example/wavs/5315.wav|EN-default|EN|She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
data/example/wavs/5316.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes had sat up upon the couch.
data/example/wavs/5317.wav|EN-default|EN|When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa,
data/example/wavs/5318.wav|EN-default|EN|there jumped five little dried orange pips.
data/example/wavs/5319.wav|EN-default|EN|but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone.
data/example/wavs/5320.wav|EN-default|EN|I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration,
data/example/wavs/5321.wav|EN-default|EN|though I was not aware in which direction he was going.
data/example/wavs/5322.wav|EN-default|EN|I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
data/example/wavs/5323.wav|EN-default|EN|that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum,
data/example/wavs/5324.wav|EN-default|EN|like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
data/example/wavs/5325.wav|EN-default|EN|it was most probable that the silent englishman
data/example/wavs/5326.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy.
data/example/wavs/5327.wav|EN-default|EN|especially as rather against the strict rules of your order
data/example/wavs/5328.wav|EN-default|EN|and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Margate.
data/example/wavs/5329.wav|EN-default|EN|and that I was Miss Alice's friend, too.
data/example/wavs/5330.wav|EN-default|EN|But as I listened to his talk, all that was.
data/example/wavs/5331.wav|EN-default|EN|which boomed out every quarter of an hour.
data/example/wavs/5332.wav|EN-default|EN|You should be ashamed of yourself.
data/example/wavs/5333.wav|EN-default|EN|but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water.
data/example/wavs/5334.wav|EN-default|EN|as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.
data/example/wavs/5335.wav|EN-default|EN|I give you my word that I would have spoken out.
data/example/wavs/5336.wav|EN-default|EN|but I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
data/example/wavs/5337.wav|EN-default|EN|I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally.
data/example/wavs/5338.wav|EN-default|EN|and brush past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
data/example/wavs/5339.wav|EN-default|EN|This is my secretary and manager.
data/example/wavs/5340.wav|EN-default|EN|A letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the Colonel's plate.
data/example/wavs/5341.wav|EN-default|EN|and my wife has given her notice, but there again—
data/example/wavs/5342.wav|EN-default|EN|when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/5343.wav|EN-default|EN|In a hundred other ways he has helped him.
data/example/wavs/5344.wav|EN-default|EN|And there was my Frank's name among the killed.
data/example/wavs/5345.wav|EN-default|EN|with whatever interest you think it right to charge.
data/example/wavs/5346.wav|EN-default|EN|She was plainly but neatly dressed.
data/example/wavs/5347.wav|EN-default|EN|His grandfather was a royal duke.
data/example/wavs/5348.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
data/example/wavs/5349.wav|EN-default|EN|with his face buried in his hands.

data/example/wavs/6071.wav|EN-default|EN|I believe that that is the village inn over there.
data/example/wavs/6072.wav|EN-default|EN|the four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him
data/example/wavs/6073.wav|EN-default|EN|and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery.
data/example/wavs/6074.wav|EN-default|EN|A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage,
data/example/wavs/6075.wav|EN-default|EN|The case is as plain as a pike-staff, and the more one goes into it,
data/example/wavs/6076.wav|EN-default|EN|Men at his time of life do not change all their habits in exchange willingly,
data/example/wavs/6077.wav|EN-default|EN|was this dark business which was acted in my house last night.
data/example/wavs/6078.wav|EN-default|EN|as he glanced down the advertisement column.
data/example/wavs/6079.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall take no notice of such nonsense.
data/example/wavs/6080.wav|EN-default|EN|in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.
data/example/wavs/6081.wav|EN-default|EN|and to point out to them that it would be better in every way
data/example/wavs/6082.wav|EN-default|EN|It was pitch dark inside the house.
data/example/wavs/6083.wav|EN-default|EN|It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.
data/example/wavs/6084.wav|EN-default|EN|but some muttered to themselves,
data/example/wavs/6085.wav|EN-default|EN|sent the Society's warning to them.
data/example/wavs/6086.wav|EN-default|EN|Old as is the idea, however,
data/example/wavs/6087.wav|EN-default|EN|It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head.
data/example/wavs/6088.wav|EN-default|EN|and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.
data/example/wavs/6089.wav|EN-default|EN|which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair.
data/example/wavs/6090.wav|EN-default|EN|and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
data/example/wavs/6091.wav|EN-default|EN|provided only that I get back the gems.
data/example/wavs/6092.wav|EN-default|EN|with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid.
data/example/wavs/6093.wav|EN-default|EN|would be fatal to our plans.
data/example/wavs/6094.wav|EN-default|EN|We have touched on three English counties in our short drive.
data/example/wavs/6095.wav|EN-default|EN|Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will fit the lock.
data/example/wavs/6096.wav|EN-default|EN|born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
data/example/wavs/6097.wav|EN-default|EN|I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
data/example/wavs/6098.wav|EN-default|EN|You are Holmes the Meddler.
data/example/wavs/6099.wav|EN-default|EN|though he bit his lip from time to time.
data/example/wavs/6100.wav|EN-default|EN|Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag.
data/example/wavs/6101.wav|EN-default|EN|Then Mr. Angel began to call.
data/example/wavs/6102.wav|EN-default|EN|and as I have no parents or relations of any sort,
data/example/wavs/6103.wav|EN-default|EN|This thing has some deadly story linked on to it.
data/example/wavs/6104.wav|EN-default|EN|with a murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.
data/example/wavs/6105.wav|EN-default|EN|was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with.
data/example/wavs/6106.wav|EN-default|EN|and the man was either a lover or a previous husband.
data/example/wavs/6107.wav|EN-default|EN|She told me to ask you.
data/example/wavs/6108.wav|EN-default|EN|telling her that she had no cause to fear.
data/example/wavs/6109.wav|EN-default|EN|but I have had a very serious accident during the night.
data/example/wavs/6110.wav|EN-default|EN|and the mind of the most resolute of men.
data/example/wavs/6111.wav|EN-default|EN|about eighteen sixty nine or eighteen seventy
data/example/wavs/6112.wav|EN-default|EN|I was overwhelmed by the honour, and attempted, when he entered, to say so.
data/example/wavs/6113.wav|EN-default|EN|The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also
data/example/wavs/6114.wav|EN-default|EN|That is not always so easy.
data/example/wavs/6115.wav|EN-default|EN|But there is, if you will excuse my saying so,
data/example/wavs/6116.wav|EN-default|EN|than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.
data/example/wavs/6117.wav|EN-default|EN|He looked from one to the other of us.
data/example/wavs/6118.wav|EN-default|EN|The crate upon which I sit contains—'
data/example/wavs/6119.wav|EN-default|EN|that you should absolutely follow my advice in
data/example/wavs/6120.wav|EN-default|EN|This is not such a populous neighbourhood.
data/example/wavs/6121.wav|EN-default|EN|I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.
data/example/wavs/6122.wav|EN-default|EN|It is possible, however, that I may have something
data/example/wavs/6123.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course, well known to you, that in a—
data/example/wavs/6124.wav|EN-default|EN|who was this very man McCarthy.

data/example/wavs/6126.wav|EN-default|EN|You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?
data/example/wavs/6127.wav|EN-default|EN|and if you would be so good as to put it on,
data/example/wavs/6128.wav|EN-default|EN|which proved, upon my approaching it,
data/example/wavs/6129.wav|EN-default|EN|Glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good news.
data/example/wavs/6130.wav|EN-default|EN|and I'm looking over the entries against him.
data/example/wavs/6131.wav|EN-default|EN|I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.
data/example/wavs/6132.wav|EN-default|EN|was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother.
data/example/wavs/6133.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylett.
data/example/wavs/6134.wav|EN-default|EN|With these I journeyed down to Streetham and saw that they exactly fitted the track.
data/example/wavs/6135.wav|EN-default|EN|my thoughts rather than my words.
data/example/wavs/6136.wav|EN-default|EN|and which he anoints with lime-cream.
data/example/wavs/6137.wav|EN-default|EN|Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter.
data/example/wavs/6138.wav|EN-default|EN|and what the object of his repeated visits.
data/example/wavs/6139.wav|EN-default|EN|I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.
data/example/wavs/6140.wav|EN-default|EN|and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.
data/example/wavs/6141.wav|EN-default|EN|We were sitting there in silence when the door opened.
data/example/wavs/6142.wav|EN-default|EN|to say that he had found his father dead in the wood,
data/example/wavs/6143.wav|EN-default|EN|I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.'
data/example/wavs/6144.wav|EN-default|EN|A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs.
data/example/wavs/6145.wav|EN-default|EN|I read nothing except the Criminal News and the Agony Column.
data/example/wavs/6146.wav|EN-default|EN|There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spark.
data/example/wavs/6147.wav|EN-default|EN|You have made your statement very clearly.
data/example/wavs/6148.wav|EN-default|EN|but Coo-ee is a distinctly Australian cry.
data/example/wavs/6149.wav|EN-default|EN|and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.
data/example/wavs/6150.wav|EN-default|EN|would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not
data/example/wavs/6151.wav|EN-default|EN|as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter.
data/example/wavs/6152.wav|EN-default|EN|to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do.
data/example/wavs/6153.wav|EN-default|EN|The police have watched this Lascar.
data/example/wavs/6154.wav|EN-default|EN|using very strong language to his son,
data/example/wavs/6155.wav|EN-default|EN|I rang the bell, and called for the weekly county paper.
data/example/wavs/6156.wav|EN-default|EN|who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game,
data/example/wavs/6157.wav|EN-default|EN|He answered, lighting a cigarette.
data/example/wavs/6158.wav|EN-default|EN|that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.
data/example/wavs/6159.wav|EN-default|EN|and she distinctly saw his face.
data/example/wavs/6160.wav|EN-default|EN|It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.
data/example/wavs/6161.wav|EN-default|EN|who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
data/example/wavs/6162.wav|EN-default|EN|and I will show you the steps by which I reached it.
data/example/wavs/6163.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart
data/example/wavs/6164.wav|EN-default|EN|not less than one thousand pounds a year.
data/example/wavs/6165.wav|EN-default|EN|laughed heartily for some minutes.
data/example/wavs/6166.wav|EN-default|EN|so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
data/example/wavs/6167.wav|EN-default|EN|We have got to the deductions and the inferences.
data/example/wavs/6168.wav|EN-default|EN|when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems.
data/example/wavs/6169.wav|EN-default|EN|Dangerous man to fall foul of.
data/example/wavs/6170.wav|EN-default|EN|has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.
data/example/wavs/6171.wav|EN-default|EN|at last, when nothing else would do,
data/example/wavs/6172.wav|EN-default|EN|as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket
data/example/wavs/6173.wav|EN-default|EN|that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
data/example/wavs/6174.wav|EN-default|EN|and to let us know what is wrong with it.
data/example/wavs/6175.wav|EN-default|EN|That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.
data/example/wavs/6176.wav|EN-default|EN|returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it.
data/example/wavs/6177.wav|EN-default|EN|which I shall expect the bank to refund,
data/example/wavs/6178.wav|EN-default|EN|having regard to his known eccentricity,
data/example/wavs/6179.wav|EN-default|EN|I could make nothing at all of what it meant.
data/example/wavs/6180.wav|EN-default|EN|I want to see whether the objections are fatal.'
data/example/wavs/6181.wav|EN-default|EN|I got his leave to come into town this morning.
data/example/wavs/6182.wav|EN-default|EN|and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation.
data/example/wavs/6183.wav|EN-default|EN|asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.
data/example/wavs/6184.wav|EN-default|EN|but I shall soon know which it is.
data/example/wavs/6185.wav|EN-default|EN|so many of my own little adventures.
data/example/wavs/6186.wav|EN-default|EN|What do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder?
data/example/wavs/6187.wav|EN-default|EN|I did what I could to relieve his pain.
data/example/wavs/6188.wav|EN-default|EN|and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.
data/example/wavs/6189.wav|EN-default|EN|He and the two mates are, as I learn,
data/example/wavs/6190.wav|EN-default|EN|and she could see that I was amused.
data/example/wavs/6191.wav|EN-default|EN|rushed back to my sister's and hurried into the back yard
data/example/wavs/6192.wav|EN-default|EN|and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
data/example/wavs/6193.wav|EN-default|EN|Upon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully.
data/example/wavs/6194.wav|EN-default|EN|and live generally in good style.
data/example/wavs/6195.wav|EN-default|EN|our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.
data/example/wavs/6196.wav|EN-default|EN|shimmering brightly in the wintry sun.
data/example/wavs/6197.wav|EN-default|EN|said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.
data/example/wavs/6198.wav|EN-default|EN|The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest.
data/example/wavs/6199.wav|EN-default|EN|as to deceive a coroner's jury.
data/example/wavs/6200.wav|EN-default|EN|you may imagine what i felt when
data/example/wavs/6201.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner.
data/example/wavs/6202.wav|EN-default|EN|so that even here in the heart of great

data/example/wavs/6204.wav|EN-default|EN|It is our French gold.
data/example/wavs/6205.wav|EN-default|EN|and a broad intelligent face.
data/example/wavs/6206.wav|EN-default|EN|and so startling in its results.
data/example/wavs/6207.wav|EN-default|EN|Fit it with a cap at either end to make itself lighting.

data/example/wavs/6210.wav|EN-default|EN|it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer.
data/example/wavs/6211.wav|EN-default|EN|but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed.
data/example/wavs/6212.wav|EN-default|EN|A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him.
data/example/wavs/6213.wav|EN-default|EN|or whether I should perch behind her landau,
data/example/wavs/6214.wav|EN-default|EN|said holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting his finger-tips together,

data/example/wavs/6217.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is the first heading upon which I come.
data/example/wavs/6218.wav|EN-default|EN|laughing at the start which I had given.
data/example/wavs/6219.wav|EN-default|EN|It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock.
data/example/wavs/6220.wav|EN-default|EN|I was conscious of a dull pain.
data/example/wavs/6221.wav|EN-default|EN|Hard and much the worse for wear.
data/example/wavs/6222.wav|EN-default|EN|entirely lost his self-respect.
data/example/wavs/6223.wav|EN-default|EN|There are three men waiting for him at the door.
data/example/wavs/6224.wav|EN-default|EN|although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured
data/example/wavs/6225.wav|EN-default|EN|if you are to understand the situation.
data/example/wavs/6226.wav|EN-default|EN|They used to send father tickets.
data/example/wavs/6227.wav|EN-default|EN|that for ten years to come at any rate
data/example/wavs/6228.wav|EN-default|EN|I had five pounds a month at my last place with Colonel Spence Monroe.
data/example/wavs/6229.wav|EN-default|EN|There are a thousand details which I should desire to know.'
data/example/wavs/6230.wav|EN-default|EN|and though we meet signs of him at every turn,
data/example/wavs/6231.wav|EN-default|EN|but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
data/example/wavs/6232.wav|EN-default|EN|with the extraordinary story of the red-headed
data/example/wavs/6233.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Rewcastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door.
data/example/wavs/6234.wav|EN-default|EN|and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
data/example/wavs/6235.wav|EN-default|EN|If not, why should you come to consult me?
data/example/wavs/6236.wav|EN-default|EN|and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
data/example/wavs/6237.wav|EN-default|EN|There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it—'
data/example/wavs/6238.wav|EN-default|EN|it might be a satisfaction to his majesty
data/example/wavs/6239.wav|EN-default|EN|My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned.
data/example/wavs/6240.wav|EN-default|EN|His attitude and manner told their own story.
data/example/wavs/6241.wav|EN-default|EN|he had no means of supporting himself,

data/example/wavs/6245.wav|EN-default|EN|But still I had such faith in Holmes's judgment that I was able to

data/example/wavs/6247.wav|EN-default|EN|to be on a very different level to your majesty.

data/example/wavs/6253.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been at some small expense over this matter.
data/example/wavs/6254.wav|EN-default|EN|that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence.
data/example/wavs/6255.wav|EN-default|EN|You really are very fine indeed.
data/example/wavs/6256.wav|EN-default|EN|This recording is by Mark Smith of Simpsonville, South Carolina.
data/example/wavs/6257.wav|EN-default|EN|but the latter had also a greater distance to come.
data/example/wavs/6258.wav|EN-default|EN|bitter in me seemed to come uppermost.
data/example/wavs/6259.wav|EN-default|EN|and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.
data/example/wavs/6260.wav|EN-default|EN|fell down senseless on the ground.
data/example/wavs/6261.wav|EN-default|EN|she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

data/example/wavs/6264.wav|EN-default|EN|He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
data/example/wavs/6265.wav|EN-default|EN|but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.
data/example/wavs/6266.wav|EN-default|EN|I have very little difficulty in finding what I want.
data/example/wavs/6267.wav|EN-default|EN|I was ten miles or so from Eiford.
data/example/wavs/6268.wav|EN-default|EN|Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?
data/example/wavs/6269.wav|EN-default|EN|our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
data/example/wavs/6270.wav|EN-default|EN|I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.
data/example/wavs/6271.wav|EN-default|EN|clad in a long grey dressing-gown,
data/example/wavs/6272.wav|EN-default|EN|It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.
data/example/wavs/6273.wav|EN-default|EN|Five attempts have been made.
data/example/wavs/6274.wav|EN-default|EN|until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
data/example/wavs/6275.wav|EN-default|EN|and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me,
data/example/wavs/6276.wav|EN-default|EN|on which he had to confess that I was right.
data/example/wavs/6277.wav|EN-default|EN|He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.
data/example/wavs/6278.wav|EN-default|EN|Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk.
data/example/wavs/6279.wav|EN-default|EN|and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself.
data/example/wavs/6280.wav|EN-default|EN|It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.
data/example/wavs/6281.wav|EN-default|EN|We descended and started off once more for Bryony Lodge.
data/example/wavs/6282.wav|EN-default|EN|He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock.
data/example/wavs/6283.wav|EN-default|EN|but it might have been a cry of surprise.
data/example/wavs/6284.wav|EN-default|EN|It is for me to ask you that.
data/example/wavs/6285.wav|EN-default|EN|He never spoke of the softer passions.

data/example/wavs/6298.wav|EN-default|EN|and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
data/example/wavs/6299.wav|EN-default|EN|until we emerged into Farrington Street.
data/example/wavs/6300.wav|EN-default|EN|Whatever it was, I gave him without question.
data/example/wavs/6301.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.
data/example/wavs/6302.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him.
data/example/wavs/6303.wav|EN-default|EN|In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match.

data/example/wavs/6315.wav|EN-default|EN|No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.
data/example/wavs/6316.wav|EN-default|EN|It seemed to me to be something grey in colour.
data/example/wavs/6317.wav|EN-default|EN|It was twenty-five minutes past four.

data/example/wavs/6320.wav|EN-default|EN|Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
data/example/wavs/6321.wav|EN-default|EN|and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/6322.wav|EN-default|EN|An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away

data/example/wavs/6324.wav|EN-default|EN|and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age.
data/example/wavs/6325.wav|EN-default|EN|We both thought the best resource was flight.
data/example/wavs/6326.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet I knew that my companion sat
data/example/wavs/6327.wav|EN-default|EN|in search of the body of Lady St. Simon.

data/example/wavs/6329.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket.
data/example/wavs/6330.wav|EN-default|EN|after he had been eight or nine years in England.
data/example/wavs/6331.wav|EN-default|EN|but without noting anything of interest.
data/example/wavs/6332.wav|EN-default|EN|So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
data/example/wavs/6333.wav|EN-default|EN|adding that he had been to the window not long before,
data/example/wavs/6334.wav|EN-default|EN|the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened,
data/example/wavs/6335.wav|EN-default|EN|care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction.
data/example/wavs/6336.wav|EN-default|EN|to Clotilde Lothman von Sachs-Meningen,
data/example/wavs/6337.wav|EN-default|EN|I met Mr. Rewcastle coming out through this door.
data/example/wavs/6338.wav|EN-default|EN|I should like an accurate description of him.
data/example/wavs/6339.wav|EN-default|EN|that the title by which I have just called myself is—
data/example/wavs/6340.wav|EN-default|EN|In the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes,
data/example/wavs/6341.wav|EN-default|EN|We've set yours aside for you.
data/example/wavs/6342.wav|EN-default|EN|but the father's laughter made me think that

data/example/wavs/6344.wav|EN-default|EN|I think it was before your time, Watson.
data/example/wavs/6345.wav|EN-default|EN|death would unfailingly come upon him.
data/example/wavs/6346.wav|EN-default|EN|Had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
data/example/wavs/6347.wav|EN-default|EN|when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night,
data/example/wavs/6348.wav|EN-default|EN|reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning.
data/example/wavs/6349.wav|EN-default|EN|Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument.
data/example/wavs/6350.wav|EN-default|EN|which is in itself a monotonous occupation.
data/example/wavs/6351.wav|EN-default|EN|amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman.
data/example/wavs/6352.wav|EN-default|EN|and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
data/example/wavs/6353.wav|EN-default|EN|In view of recent occurrences,
data/example/wavs/6354.wav|EN-default|EN|When you see a man with whiskers of that cut,
data/example/wavs/6355.wav|EN-default|EN|He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and the son.
data/example/wavs/6356.wav|EN-default|EN|of the singular adventures of the Grice Pattersons in the island of Uffa.
data/example/wavs/6357.wav|EN-default|EN|and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them.
data/example/wavs/6358.wav|EN-default|EN|so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.
data/example/wavs/6359.wav|EN-default|EN|as of the swimmer who leaves the bank.
data/example/wavs/6360.wav|EN-default|EN|Had I been recognized in that den, my life would not have been worth
data/example/wavs/6361.wav|EN-default|EN|or at least in the building, the whole time.
data/example/wavs/6362.wav|EN-default|EN|How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?
data/example/wavs/6363.wav|EN-default|EN|and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road
data/example/wavs/6364.wav|EN-default|EN|and a second double line which I saw with delight.
data/example/wavs/6365.wav|EN-default|EN|Why should they give you 120 pounds a year?
data/example/wavs/6366.wav|EN-default|EN|It is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.
data/example/wavs/6367.wav|EN-default|EN|as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
data/example/wavs/6368.wav|EN-default|EN|About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished.

data/example/wavs/6373.wav|EN-default|EN|who made his money in Australia,
data/example/wavs/6374.wav|EN-default|EN|A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face.
data/example/wavs/6375.wav|EN-default|EN|226 Gordon Square.
data/example/wavs/6376.wav|EN-default|EN|I did not scorn her advice.
data/example/wavs/6377.wav|EN-default|EN|which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed to it.
data/example/wavs/6378.wav|EN-default|EN|and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.
data/example/wavs/6379.wav|EN-default|EN|which seemed to tax his powers so sorely,
data/example/wavs/6380.wav|EN-default|EN|but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes.
data/example/wavs/6381.wav|EN-default|EN|it would be difficult to suggest a better.
data/example/wavs/6382.wav|EN-default|EN|tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand.
data/example/wavs/6383.wav|EN-default|EN|I knelt beside him for some minutes.
data/example/wavs/6384.wav|EN-default|EN|That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/6385.wav|EN-default|EN|Your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next.
data/example/wavs/6386.wav|EN-default|EN|and that she, with confederates, no doubt,
data/example/wavs/6387.wav|EN-default|EN|looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
data/example/wavs/6388.wav|EN-default|EN|It is a question of hydraulics, you see.
data/example/wavs/6389.wav|EN-default|EN|When Lee laid down his arms, my uncle returned to his plantation.
data/example/wavs/6390.wav|EN-default|EN|The Church of St. Monica John?
data/example/wavs/6391.wav|EN-default|EN|The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow,
data/example/wavs/6392.wav|EN-default|EN|The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.
data/example/wavs/6393.wav|EN-default|EN|but it never really became bad for her.
data/example/wavs/6394.wav|EN-default|EN|for he is a man of immense strength.
data/example/wavs/6395.wav|EN-default|EN|It is indeed the missing man.
data/example/wavs/6396.wav|EN-default|EN|does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours,
data/example/wavs/6397.wav|EN-default|EN|The matter implicates the great house of Ormstein.
data/example/wavs/6398.wav|EN-default|EN|As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
data/example/wavs/6399.wav|EN-default|EN|and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion.
data/example/wavs/6400.wav|EN-default|EN|So what does her stepfather do?
data/example/wavs/6401.wav|EN-default|EN|Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her
data/example/wavs/6402.wav|EN-default|EN|I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones.
data/example/wavs/6403.wav|EN-default|EN|When I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint,
data/example/wavs/6404.wav|EN-default|EN|the whole matter to your consideration.
data/example/wavs/6405.wav|EN-default|EN|Male costume is nothing new to me.
data/example/wavs/6406.wav|EN-default|EN|while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.
data/example/wavs/6407.wav|EN-default|EN|but not before the roof had fallen in.
data/example/wavs/6408.wav|EN-default|EN|the body exhibited no traces of violence,
data/example/wavs/6409.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall take your advice in every particular.
data/example/wavs/6410.wav|EN-default|EN|I was all on fire to go over them.
data/example/wavs/6411.wav|EN-default|EN|got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite,
data/example/wavs/6412.wav|EN-default|EN|but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse.
data/example/wavs/6413.wav|EN-default|EN|and I should be very glad if you would take the matter up.
data/example/wavs/6414.wav|EN-default|EN|We travelled by the underground as far as Aldersgate.
data/example/wavs/6415.wav|EN-default|EN|Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den,
data/example/wavs/6416.wav|EN-default|EN|Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount.
data/example/wavs/6417.wav|EN-default|EN|can't imagine how you deduce it.
data/example/wavs/6418.wav|EN-default|EN|down at the table with his pen in his hand.
data/example/wavs/6419.wav|EN-default|EN|from some foolish freak when he was at college.
data/example/wavs/6420.wav|EN-default|EN|My sister asked me what was the matter.
data/example/wavs/6421.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis.
data/example/wavs/6422.wav|EN-default|EN|all father's friends were to be there.
data/example/wavs/6423.wav|EN-default|EN|Her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
data/example/wavs/6424.wav|EN-default|EN|and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us.
data/example/wavs/6425.wav|EN-default|EN|But, my dear fellow, there lies the problem.
data/example/wavs/6426.wav|EN-default|EN|He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.
data/example/wavs/6427.wav|EN-default|EN|because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life.
data/example/wavs/6428.wav|EN-default|EN|and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor.
data/example/wavs/6429.wav|EN-default|EN|It was at the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at Horsham.
data/example/wavs/6430.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, yes, save perhaps that.
data/example/wavs/6431.wav|EN-default|EN|thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
data/example/wavs/6432.wav|EN-default|EN|said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence.
data/example/wavs/6433.wav|EN-default|EN|and from the cloths with which the light shone upon her dark
data/example/wavs/6434.wav|EN-default|EN|after the fashion of old country houses.
data/example/wavs/6435.wav|EN-default|EN|he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper,
data/example/wavs/6436.wav|EN-default|EN|Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic?
data/example/wavs/6437.wav|EN-default|EN|because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was
data/example/wavs/6438.wav|EN-default|EN|Those are the main facts of the case.
data/example/wavs/6439.wav|EN-default|EN|To my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.
data/example/wavs/6440.wav|EN-default|EN|Do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man.
data/example/wavs/6441.wav|EN-default|EN|I should like to chat this little matter over with you.
data/example/wavs/6442.wav|EN-default|EN|but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding,
data/example/wavs/6443.wav|EN-default|EN|down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square,
data/example/wavs/6444.wav|EN-default|EN|and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck, he drew it from its horrid perch,
data/example/wavs/6445.wav|EN-default|EN|The windows of the three rooms opened out upon the lawn.
data/example/wavs/6446.wav|EN-default|EN|that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square.
data/example/wavs/6447.wav|EN-default|EN|and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.
data/example/wavs/6448.wav|EN-default|EN|and now you must on no account lose another instant.
data/example/wavs/6449.wav|EN-default|EN|he cut a slice of bread from the joint upon the sideboard,
data/example/wavs/6450.wav|EN-default|EN|Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?
data/example/wavs/6451.wav|EN-default|EN|so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.
data/example/wavs/6452.wav|EN-default|EN|and I would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.
data/example/wavs/6453.wav|EN-default|EN|We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas,
data/example/wavs/6454.wav|EN-default|EN|and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a
data/example/wavs/6455.wav|EN-default|EN|because there are no hills there.
data/example/wavs/6456.wav|EN-default|EN|and then, seeing that there were two of us,
data/example/wavs/6457.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection.
data/example/wavs/6458.wav|EN-default|EN|The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.
data/example/wavs/6459.wav|EN-default|EN|that there is hardly a case upon record
data/example/wavs/6460.wav|EN-default|EN|Mrs. Rewcastle came down just after breakfast,
data/example/wavs/6461.wav|EN-default|EN|By this time the whole house was astir.
data/example/wavs/6462.wav|EN-default|EN|upon which he perched himself cross-legged.
data/example/wavs/6463.wav|EN-default|EN|found ourselves at the pretty little country town of Ross.
data/example/wavs/6464.wav|EN-default|EN|but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's.
data/example/wavs/6465.wav|EN-default|EN|I met him first at the gas-fitter's ball.
data/example/wavs/6466.wav|EN-default|EN|my companion speedily overtook the little man,
data/example/wavs/6467.wav|EN-default|EN|which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.
data/example/wavs/6468.wav|EN-default|EN|and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
data/example/wavs/6469.wav|EN-default|EN|Where is your father's place of business?
data/example/wavs/6470.wav|EN-default|EN|She came with an excellent character, however.
data/example/wavs/6471.wav|EN-default|EN|For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beaches my life was very quiet.
data/example/wavs/6472.wav|EN-default|EN|put up the shutters for the day,
data/example/wavs/6473.wav|EN-default|EN|You're looking at the wrong side.
data/example/wavs/6474.wav|EN-default|EN|And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and
data/example/wavs/6475.wav|EN-default|EN|as he was allowed some few minutes during which

data/example/wavs/6477.wav|EN-default|EN|and i am very sorry if i have given you pain
data/example/wavs/6478.wav|EN-default|EN|and that it had ended with the last generation.
data/example/wavs/6479.wav|EN-default|EN|The others are Finns and Germans.
data/example/wavs/6480.wav|EN-default|EN|We shall now carry our researchers into the inner apartment.
data/example/wavs/6481.wav|EN-default|EN|I found my plans very seriously menaced.
data/example/wavs/6482.wav|EN-default|EN|His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England,
data/example/wavs/6483.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!
data/example/wavs/6484.wav|EN-default|EN|and my hearing was so acute
data/example/wavs/6485.wav|EN-default|EN|when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand.
data/example/wavs/6486.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.
data/example/wavs/6487.wav|EN-default|EN|When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him.

data/example/wavs/6489.wav|EN-default|EN|There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.
data/example/wavs/6490.wav|EN-default|EN|I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a muse in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.
data/example/wavs/6491.wav|EN-default|EN|still looking keenly at the houses.

data/example/wavs/6502.wav|EN-default|EN|You'll never persuade me to believe that.
data/example/wavs/6503.wav|EN-default|EN|seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
data/example/wavs/6504.wav|EN-default|EN|Recently he has been drinking hard.
data/example/wavs/6505.wav|EN-default|EN|there is that double possibility.
data/example/wavs/6506.wav|EN-default|EN|after the fashion of my companion,
data/example/wavs/6507.wav|EN-default|EN|It was my coil of hair.
data/example/wavs/6508.wav|EN-default|EN|there can be no question as to their nature.
data/example/wavs/6509.wav|EN-default|EN|for the only problem we have still to solve is
data/example/wavs/6510.wav|EN-default|EN|who was as amiable as ever,
data/example/wavs/6511.wav|EN-default|EN|There was the huge famished brute,
data/example/wavs/6512.wav|EN-default|EN|from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you,

data/example/wavs/6517.wav|EN-default|EN|of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side.
data/example/wavs/6518.wav|EN-default|EN|and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part.
data/example/wavs/6519.wav|EN-default|EN|We never know where to find the man himself.
data/example/wavs/6520.wav|EN-default|EN|and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
data/example/wavs/6521.wav|EN-default|EN|just as i came to the altar rails
data/example/wavs/6522.wav|EN-default|EN|As I turned to speak to her, the brute broke loose.
data/example/wavs/6523.wav|EN-default|EN|that it is all perfectly familiar to me.
data/example/wavs/6524.wav|EN-default|EN|He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked.
data/example/wavs/6525.wav|EN-default|EN|and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker.
data/example/wavs/6526.wav|EN-default|EN|I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it.
data/example/wavs/6527.wav|EN-default|EN|I took the precious case into my hands.
data/example/wavs/6528.wav|EN-default|EN|That is clear enough, certainly.
data/example/wavs/6529.wav|EN-default|EN|I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives.
data/example/wavs/6530.wav|EN-default|EN|cross-indexing his records of crime.

data/example/wavs/6536.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Fowler and Miss Reucastle were married.
data/example/wavs/6537.wav|EN-default|EN|there was a rush of constables up the stair,

data/example/wavs/6549.wav|EN-default|EN|I feel that no memoir of him would be complete.
data/example/wavs/6550.wav|EN-default|EN|to make up for the way in which I had earned it.
data/example/wavs/6551.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.
data/example/wavs/6552.wav|EN-default|EN|answered in a gruff monosyllable,
data/example/wavs/6553.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bread.
data/example/wavs/6554.wav|EN-default|EN|have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moved.
data/example/wavs/6555.wav|EN-default|EN|when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage.
data/example/wavs/6556.wav|EN-default|EN|Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,
data/example/wavs/6557.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit
data/example/wavs/6558.wav|EN-default|EN|with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls.
data/example/wavs/6559.wav|EN-default|EN|He has one positive virtue.

data/example/wavs/6562.wav|EN-default|EN|Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill.
data/example/wavs/6563.wav|EN-default|EN|living the life which I have described.
data/example/wavs/6564.wav|EN-default|EN|we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.
data/example/wavs/6565.wav|EN-default|EN|Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium.
data/example/wavs/6566.wav|EN-default|EN|There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder.
data/example/wavs/6567.wav|EN-default|EN|Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks.
data/example/wavs/6568.wav|EN-default|EN|The blow was struck from immediately behind.
data/example/wavs/6569.wav|EN-default|EN|As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
data/example/wavs/6570.wav|EN-default|EN|came to seek a theory, not to propound one.
data/example/wavs/6571.wav|EN-default|EN|and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.
data/example/wavs/6572.wav|EN-default|EN|It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.
data/example/wavs/6573.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.
data/example/wavs/6574.wav|EN-default|EN|Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
data/example/wavs/6575.wav|EN-default|EN|I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife.
data/example/wavs/6576.wav|EN-default|EN|No, it is not even attached to a wire.
data/example/wavs/6577.wav|EN-default|EN|I have my duties just the same as you.
data/example/wavs/6578.wav|EN-default|EN|there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are
data/example/wavs/6579.wav|EN-default|EN|Apply in person on Monday at 11 o'clock.
data/example/wavs/6580.wav|EN-default|EN|and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy.
data/example/wavs/6581.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/6582.wav|EN-default|EN|I really have made no inquiries on the subject.
data/example/wavs/6583.wav|EN-default|EN|the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair,
data/example/wavs/6584.wav|EN-default|EN|upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out.
data/example/wavs/6585.wav|EN-default|EN|would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.
data/example/wavs/6586.wav|EN-default|EN|I took two steps forward and looked back.
data/example/wavs/6587.wav|EN-default|EN|you are probably aware that Fuller's Earth is a valuable product.
data/example/wavs/6588.wav|EN-default|EN|threatens to send them the photograph.
data/example/wavs/6589.wav|EN-default|EN|for I should like to see the solution of so.
data/example/wavs/6590.wav|EN-default|EN|and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.
data/example/wavs/6591.wav|EN-default|EN|is so ill that his life is despaired of.
data/example/wavs/6592.wav|EN-default|EN|imploring me to come at once.
data/example/wavs/6593.wav|EN-default|EN|Be in your chamber then at that hour.
data/example/wavs/6594.wav|EN-default|EN|I seemed to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil,
data/example/wavs/6595.wav|EN-default|EN|This account of you we have from all quarters received.
data/example/wavs/6596.wav|EN-default|EN|to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose.
data/example/wavs/6597.wav|EN-default|EN|and I know his faults as no one else does.
data/example/wavs/6598.wav|EN-default|EN|caught a glimpse of rushing figures,
data/example/wavs/6599.wav|EN-default|EN|with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.
data/example/wavs/6600.wav|EN-default|EN|There is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.
data/example/wavs/6601.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet Mr. Rewcastle seemed to take no notice of it.
data/example/wavs/6602.wav|EN-default|EN|built firmly into the massive masonry.
data/example/wavs/6603.wav|EN-default|EN|The will is very clear upon that time.
data/example/wavs/6604.wav|EN-default|EN|for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
data/example/wavs/6605.wav|EN-default|EN|You will excuse this mask.
data/example/wavs/6606.wav|EN-default|EN|with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat.
data/example/wavs/6607.wav|EN-default|EN|This would be in the year 1878.
data/example/wavs/6608.wav|EN-default|EN|white with chagrin and surprise,
data/example/wavs/6609.wav|EN-default|EN|There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.
data/example/wavs/6610.wav|EN-default|EN|Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing.
data/example/wavs/6611.wav|EN-default|EN|No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.
data/example/wavs/6612.wav|EN-default|EN|and when I found that the bark lone star was there in January 85,
data/example/wavs/6613.wav|EN-default|EN|should take a considerable interest in this cellar.
data/example/wavs/6614.wav|EN-default|EN|not more than five-and-twenty, I should say.
data/example/wavs/6615.wav|EN-default|EN|But if you shift your own point of view a little,
data/example/wavs/6616.wav|EN-default|EN|I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that
data/example/wavs/6617.wav|EN-default|EN|In Dundee it was only some three or four days.
data/example/wavs/6618.wav|EN-default|EN|You were the first to have ever heard my story.
data/example/wavs/6619.wav|EN-default|EN|though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.
data/example/wavs/6620.wav|EN-default|EN|I am a widower. I never had any family.
data/example/wavs/6621.wav|EN-default|EN|At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.
data/example/wavs/6622.wav|EN-default|EN|You want to know what became of those geese?
data/example/wavs/6623.wav|EN-default|EN|fingertips upon the edge of the table.
data/example/wavs/6624.wav|EN-default|EN|If you are trivial, I cannot blame you.
data/example/wavs/6625.wav|EN-default|EN|paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
data/example/wavs/6626.wav|EN-default|EN|and so uncertain as to his fate.
data/example/wavs/6627.wav|EN-default|EN|formed any definite conception as to what these perils are,
data/example/wavs/6628.wav|EN-default|EN|I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.
data/example/wavs/6629.wav|EN-default|EN|he had emerged in no very sweet temper,
data/example/wavs/6630.wav|EN-default|EN|for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.
data/example/wavs/6631.wav|EN-default|EN|I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.
data/example/wavs/6632.wav|EN-default|EN|So Frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them.
data/example/wavs/6633.wav|EN-default|EN|he slipped an emerald snake-ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
data/example/wavs/6634.wav|EN-default|EN|and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
data/example/wavs/6635.wav|EN-default|EN|It is so very kind of you both.
data/example/wavs/6636.wav|EN-default|EN|but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand
data/example/wavs/6637.wav|EN-default|EN|had he appeared surprised at his own arrest.
data/example/wavs/6638.wav|EN-default|EN|for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians
data/example/wavs/6639.wav|EN-default|EN|but he would see no society and did not want any friends.
data/example/wavs/6640.wav|EN-default|EN|All he wants is an old dog to help him do the running down.
data/example/wavs/6641.wav|EN-default|EN|while others had been but partially cleared up.
data/example/wavs/6642.wav|EN-default|EN|These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw.
data/example/wavs/6643.wav|EN-default|EN|but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
data/example/wavs/6644.wav|EN-default|EN|so that he might have a private word with us.
data/example/wavs/6645.wav|EN-default|EN|and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
data/example/wavs/6646.wav|EN-default|EN|During that time she ran free in a mining camp,
data/example/wavs/6647.wav|EN-default|EN|which appeared not to be inhabited at all.
data/example/wavs/6648.wav|EN-default|EN|by Uncle Elias and my father.
data/example/wavs/6649.wav|EN-default|EN|and his father did not know where he was.
data/example/wavs/6650.wav|EN-default|EN|One was the fact that his father should—
data/example/wavs/6651.wav|EN-default|EN|that my fears are so vague.
data/example/wavs/6652.wav|EN-default|EN|there seems to me to be only one possible solution.
data/example/wavs/6653.wav|EN-default|EN|and the air of a man who is lost in thought.
data/example/wavs/6654.wav|EN-default|EN|but he passed away without having ever
data/example/wavs/6655.wav|EN-default|EN|who was introduced to me as Mr.
data/example/wavs/6656.wav|EN-default|EN|We sat in silence for some minutes.
data/example/wavs/6657.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/6658.wav|EN-default|EN|he had no friends at all save the wandering gypsies
data/example/wavs/6659.wav|EN-default|EN|and associate him with this investigation.
data/example/wavs/6660.wav|EN-default|EN|We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door.
data/example/wavs/6661.wav|EN-default|EN|Both these witnesses deposed that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone.
data/example/wavs/6662.wav|EN-default|EN|dreadful time is seared into my memory.
data/example/wavs/6663.wav|EN-default|EN|evidently the man of whom I had heard.
data/example/wavs/6664.wav|EN-default|EN|rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment,
data/example/wavs/6665.wav|EN-default|EN|were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand,
data/example/wavs/6666.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road,
data/example/wavs/6667.wav|EN-default|EN|and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.
data/example/wavs/6668.wav|EN-default|EN|I know that he has done no harm, and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.
data/example/wavs/6669.wav|EN-default|EN|when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings,
data/example/wavs/6670.wav|EN-default|EN|and the two constables at the door saluted him.
data/example/wavs/6671.wav|EN-default|EN|Nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.
data/example/wavs/6672.wav|EN-default|EN|Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday tomorrow.
data/example/wavs/6673.wav|EN-default|EN|and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.
data/example/wavs/6674.wav|EN-default|EN|there would be one to Reading in less than an hour.
data/example/wavs/6675.wav|EN-default|EN|There he is, all safe and sound.
data/example/wavs/6676.wav|EN-default|EN|The papers which Openshaw carried are—

data/example/wavs/6678.wav|EN-default|EN|I am afraid that I am a little late.
data/example/wavs/6679.wav|EN-default|EN|and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men.
data/example/wavs/6680.wav|EN-default|EN|and has seen very little of life yet, and—'
data/example/wavs/6681.wav|EN-default|EN|The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse and Marbank,
data/example/wavs/6682.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller.
data/example/wavs/6683.wav|EN-default|EN|had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's earth was sufficient
data/example/wavs/6684.wav|EN-default|EN|They were admirable things for the observer.
data/example/wavs/6685.wav|EN-default|EN|That is what Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard
data/example/wavs/6686.wav|EN-default|EN|You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest.
data/example/wavs/6687.wav|EN-default|EN|The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room.
data/example/wavs/6688.wav|EN-default|EN|When you go out, close the door, for there is a decided draft.
data/example/wavs/6689.wav|EN-default|EN|Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission?
data/example/wavs/6690.wav|EN-default|EN|but the floor consisted of a large iron trough.
data/example/wavs/6691.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of
data/example/wavs/6692.wav|EN-default|EN|The gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing McCarthy pass,
data/example/wavs/6693.wav|EN-default|EN|Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic.
data/example/wavs/6694.wav|EN-default|EN|The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
data/example/wavs/6695.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe.
data/example/wavs/6696.wav|EN-default|EN|with corridors passages
data/example/wavs/6697.wav|EN-default|EN|came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland,
data/example/wavs/6698.wav|EN-default|EN|and is extreme anxiety lest I should tell any one of my errand.
data/example/wavs/6699.wav|EN-default|EN|two of which ended in the police-court.
data/example/wavs/6700.wav|EN-default|EN|I braved him to do his worst.
data/example/wavs/6701.wav|EN-default|EN|Yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.
data/example/wavs/6702.wav|EN-default|EN|I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light.
data/example/wavs/6703.wav|EN-default|EN|with this very paper in his hand,
data/example/wavs/6704.wav|EN-default|EN|with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.
data/example/wavs/6705.wav|EN-default|EN|and his breath seemed to span it across from side to side.
data/example/wavs/6706.wav|EN-default|EN|when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope.
data/example/wavs/6707.wav|EN-default|EN|save some twisted cylinders and iron piping.
data/example/wavs/6708.wav|EN-default|EN|to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper
data/example/wavs/6709.wav|EN-default|EN|Anne brought Miss Hunter down from London
data/example/wavs/6710.wav|EN-default|EN|It gave the name and the church, but—'
data/example/wavs/6711.wav|EN-default|EN|Just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.
data/example/wavs/6712.wav|EN-default|EN|There's 26 of them, which makes one for you.
data/example/wavs/6713.wav|EN-default|EN|Besides, what use was my hair to me?
data/example/wavs/6714.wav|EN-default|EN|We waited, all curiosity.
data/example/wavs/6715.wav|EN-default|EN|and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather
data/example/wavs/6716.wav|EN-default|EN|and a few moments later a clanging sound,
data/example/wavs/6717.wav|EN-default|EN|he travels for west house and marbank
data/example/wavs/6718.wav|EN-default|EN|and went out to Calcutta,
data/example/wavs/6719.wav|EN-default|EN|Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people,
data/example/wavs/6720.wav|EN-default|EN|At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect.
data/example/wavs/6721.wav|EN-default|EN|which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
data/example/wavs/6722.wav|EN-default|EN|to Grimsby Roylett of Stoke Moran.
data/example/wavs/6723.wav|EN-default|EN|What did you understand by that?
data/example/wavs/6724.wav|EN-default|EN|and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back.
data/example/wavs/6725.wav|EN-default|EN|Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson?"
data/example/wavs/6726.wav|EN-default|EN|I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.
data/example/wavs/6727.wav|EN-default|EN|You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?
data/example/wavs/6728.wav|EN-default|EN|He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases.
data/example/wavs/6729.wav|EN-default|EN|when we had all three read this epistle.
data/example/wavs/6730.wav|EN-default|EN|interesting than it promised to be.
data/example/wavs/6731.wav|EN-default|EN|and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading.
data/example/wavs/6732.wav|EN-default|EN|and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
data/example/wavs/6733.wav|EN-default|EN|From that appointment he never came back alive.
data/example/wavs/6734.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall be at Baker Street at ten.
data/example/wavs/6735.wav|EN-default|EN|It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.
data/example/wavs/6736.wav|EN-default|EN|but the right-hand block was comparatively modern.
data/example/wavs/6737.wav|EN-default|EN|which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Duran.
data/example/wavs/6738.wav|EN-default|EN|with a hand on either side of the aperture,
data/example/wavs/6739.wav|EN-default|EN|and the Colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
data/example/wavs/6740.wav|EN-default|EN|and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.
data/example/wavs/6741.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, after a long silence.
data/example/wavs/6742.wav|EN-default|EN|a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door,
data/example/wavs/6743.wav|EN-default|EN|in whom I was not in the least interested,
data/example/wavs/6744.wav|EN-default|EN|I have seen the will of the deceased wife.
data/example/wavs/6745.wav|EN-default|EN|and to have been under such obligations to turner
data/example/wavs/6746.wav|EN-default|EN|It will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.
data/example/wavs/6747.wav|EN-default|EN|but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point.
data/example/wavs/6748.wav|EN-default|EN|by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years.
data/example/wavs/6749.wav|EN-default|EN|I returned to the main chamber of the machine,
data/example/wavs/6750.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you not deduce something from that?
data/example/wavs/6751.wav|EN-default|EN|draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.
data/example/wavs/6752.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that there you ask a little too much.
data/example/wavs/6753.wav|EN-default|EN|it is most refreshingly unusual.
data/example/wavs/6754.wav|EN-default|EN|who knew how he winced from the very thought of death,
data/example/wavs/6755.wav|EN-default|EN|and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink,
data/example/wavs/6756.wav|EN-default|EN|and less innocent aspect.
data/example/wavs/6757.wav|EN-default|EN|I never went wrong before!
data/example/wavs/6758.wav|EN-default|EN|This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.
data/example/wavs/6759.wav|EN-default|EN|and our party is still remembered in the colony as the
data/example/wavs/6760.wav|EN-default|EN|Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man.
data/example/wavs/6761.wav|EN-default|EN|Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
data/example/wavs/6762.wav|EN-default|EN|there was an old chest of drawers in the room,
data/example/wavs/6763.wav|EN-default|EN|She showed me, as I told you she would.
data/example/wavs/6764.wav|EN-default|EN|the instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.
data/example/wavs/6765.wav|EN-default|EN|and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed.
data/example/wavs/6766.wav|EN-default|EN|I have not treated her ungenerously.
data/example/wavs/6767.wav|EN-default|EN|He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there.
data/example/wavs/6768.wav|EN-default|EN|Two hours passed slowly away.
data/example/wavs/6769.wav|EN-default|EN|The problem connected with the man with the twisted lip.
data/example/wavs/6770.wav|EN-default|EN|that we may let some light into this dark place.
data/example/wavs/6771.wav|EN-default|EN|continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
data/example/wavs/6772.wav|EN-default|EN|disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.
data/example/wavs/6773.wav|EN-default|EN|but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information
data/example/wavs/6774.wav|EN-default|EN|and came in by the first train to Waterloo.
data/example/wavs/6775.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, he was very good about it.
data/example/wavs/6776.wav|EN-default|EN|but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears.
data/example/wavs/6777.wav|EN-default|EN|He is one of the most dangerous men in England.
data/example/wavs/6778.wav|EN-default|EN|who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
data/example/wavs/6779.wav|EN-default|EN|If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning—'
data/example/wavs/6780.wav|EN-default|EN|and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.
data/example/wavs/6781.wav|EN-default|EN|It is really two days since you had the letter.
data/example/wavs/6782.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair,
data/example/wavs/6783.wav|EN-default|EN|and that woman was the late Irene Adler.

data/example/wavs/6867.wav|EN-default|EN|There is serious news this morning.

data/example/wavs/6879.wav|EN-default|EN|for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal.
data/example/wavs/6880.wav|EN-default|EN|and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss.
data/example/wavs/6881.wav|EN-default|EN|Who is this KKK, and why does he pursue this unhappy family?
data/example/wavs/6882.wav|EN-default|EN|I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter.
data/example/wavs/6883.wav|EN-default|EN|as the daughter could not have been less than twenty,
data/example/wavs/6884.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.
data/example/wavs/6885.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them.
data/example/wavs/6886.wav|EN-default|EN|and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
data/example/wavs/6887.wav|EN-default|EN|gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.

data/example/wavs/6900.wav|EN-default|EN|It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married,
data/example/wavs/6901.wav|EN-default|EN|I beg that you will look upon it, not in the eyes of the devil.
data/example/wavs/6902.wav|EN-default|EN|But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours. Three pipes.
data/example/wavs/6903.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.
data/example/wavs/6904.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be able to look after that for you.
data/example/wavs/6905.wav|EN-default|EN|I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.

data/example/wavs/6913.wav|EN-default|EN|What is the young man's own account of the matter?
data/example/wavs/6914.wav|EN-default|EN|and he had fixed it all up so nicely.
data/example/wavs/6915.wav|EN-default|EN|if I tell her she will not believe me.
data/example/wavs/6916.wav|EN-default|EN|The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride.
data/example/wavs/6917.wav|EN-default|EN|You will find it rather disconnected, I fear.
data/example/wavs/6918.wav|EN-default|EN|He wore rather baggy gray, shepherd's-check trousers.
data/example/wavs/6919.wav|EN-default|EN|I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front.
data/example/wavs/6920.wav|EN-default|EN|all huddled in a chair.
data/example/wavs/6921.wav|EN-default|EN|and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair.
data/example/wavs/6922.wav|EN-default|EN|that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.
data/example/wavs/6923.wav|EN-default|EN|but he was exceedingly pale, and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation.
data/example/wavs/6924.wav|EN-default|EN|Within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most

data/example/wavs/6926.wav|EN-default|EN|I have already offered a reward of one thousand pounds.
data/example/wavs/6927.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes turned to his desk and—
data/example/wavs/6928.wav|EN-default|EN|That is unusual in a young girl.
data/example/wavs/6929.wav|EN-default|EN|and a great greasy-backed one
data/example/wavs/6930.wav|EN-default|EN|There is one remarkable point, however,
data/example/wavs/6931.wav|EN-default|EN|but when I gave him every particular that had occurred,
data/example/wavs/6932.wav|EN-default|EN|with a certainty that it would crawl down the rope
data/example/wavs/6933.wav|EN-default|EN|I should not have thought there were so many in the whole
data/example/wavs/6934.wav|EN-default|EN|with restless, frightened eyes,
data/example/wavs/6935.wav|EN-default|EN|The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
data/example/wavs/6936.wav|EN-default|EN|By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that

data/example/wavs/6938.wav|EN-default|EN|I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely.

data/example/wavs/6943.wav|EN-default|EN|All this is amusing, though rather elementary.
data/example/wavs/6944.wav|EN-default|EN|It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.
data/example/wavs/6945.wav|EN-default|EN|if an action for breach of promise were instituted.
data/example/wavs/6946.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought that I was out of geese.

data/example/wavs/6966.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, as we climbed the stile.
data/example/wavs/6967.wav|EN-default|EN|I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.
data/example/wavs/6968.wav|EN-default|EN|The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her.
data/example/wavs/6969.wav|EN-default|EN|but it is not sure that the matter is not

data/example/wavs/7269.wav|EN-default|EN|That is very serious indeed.
data/example/wavs/7270.wav|EN-default|EN|said I, as I stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street.
data/example/wavs/7271.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall glance into the case for you.
data/example/wavs/7272.wav|EN-default|EN|that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a

data/example/wavs/7282.wav|EN-default|EN|and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men.

data/example/wavs/7288.wav|EN-default|EN|I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.
data/example/wavs/7289.wav|EN-default|EN|and very energetic inquiries are being made.
data/example/wavs/7290.wav|EN-default|EN|leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.
data/example/wavs/7291.wav|EN-default|EN|He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.

data/example/wavs/7328.wav|EN-default|EN|which surely he restored to their owner.
data/example/wavs/7329.wav|EN-default|EN|which felt about in the centre of the little area of light.

data/example/wavs/7370.wav|EN-default|EN|You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief.
data/example/wavs/7371.wav|EN-default|EN|until she disappeared into your dressing-room.
data/example/wavs/7372.wav|EN-default|EN|so that I had an admirable opportunity.
data/example/wavs/7373.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.

data/example/wavs/7378.wav|EN-default|EN|but a very serious one to me.
data/example/wavs/7379.wav|EN-default|EN|What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles?

data/example/wavs/7393.wav|EN-default|EN|It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter.

data/example/wavs/7396.wav|EN-default|EN|but Hosmer was very independent about money,
data/example/wavs/7397.wav|EN-default|EN|and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.

data/example/wavs/7402.wav|EN-default|EN|told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so
data/example/wavs/7403.wav|EN-default|EN|The case would then never go into court at all.
data/example/wavs/7404.wav|EN-default|EN|and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
data/example/wavs/7405.wav|EN-default|EN|so that whether she married or not

data/example/wavs/7408.wav|EN-default|EN|he was never so truly formidable as when
data/example/wavs/7409.wav|EN-default|EN|for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
data/example/wavs/7410.wav|EN-default|EN|gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner,
data/example/wavs/7411.wav|EN-default|EN|This incident gives zest to our investigation, however.
data/example/wavs/7412.wav|EN-default|EN|you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room,
data/example/wavs/7413.wav|EN-default|EN|but whether north, south, east, or west, I had no idea.
data/example/wavs/7414.wav|EN-default|EN|He remarked that he was not surprised to hear it.
data/example/wavs/7415.wav|EN-default|EN|and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
data/example/wavs/7416.wav|EN-default|EN|though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight.
data/example/wavs/7417.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course, that is only just for the time.
data/example/wavs/7418.wav|EN-default|EN|and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.
data/example/wavs/7419.wav|EN-default|EN|We shall spend the night in your room.
data/example/wavs/7420.wav|EN-default|EN|I have endeavored in my case to do.

data/example/wavs/7422.wav|EN-default|EN|He missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
data/example/wavs/7423.wav|EN-default|EN|I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter.
data/example/wavs/7424.wav|EN-default|EN|but I want to find out about them.
data/example/wavs/7425.wav|EN-default|EN|though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room.
data/example/wavs/7426.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes slowly reopened his eyes.
data/example/wavs/7427.wav|EN-default|EN|was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
data/example/wavs/7428.wav|EN-default|EN|He has always answered me like that.
data/example/wavs/7429.wav|EN-default|EN|amid the white creases of his face,
data/example/wavs/7430.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on, of your own bird, so if you wish—
data/example/wavs/7431.wav|EN-default|EN|The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's,
data/example/wavs/7432.wav|EN-default|EN|His grip has been upon me these twenty years.

data/example/wavs/7434.wav|EN-default|EN|who took sides with one of the loungers,
data/example/wavs/7435.wav|EN-default|EN|they have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
data/example/wavs/7436.wav|EN-default|EN|for the remainder of your existence.
data/example/wavs/7437.wav|EN-default|EN|He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window
data/example/wavs/7438.wav|EN-default|EN|and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.
data/example/wavs/7439.wav|EN-default|EN|He drew up his chair very close to mine.
data/example/wavs/7440.wav|EN-default|EN|could not come either from the window or the door.
data/example/wavs/7441.wav|EN-default|EN|and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
data/example/wavs/7442.wav|EN-default|EN|and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight,
data/example/wavs/7443.wav|EN-default|EN|You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson.
data/example/wavs/7444.wav|EN-default|EN|and from the window we could see Mr. James Windybank,

data/example/wavs/7447.wav|EN-default|EN|It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves.
data/example/wavs/7448.wav|EN-default|EN|and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation.
data/example/wavs/7449.wav|EN-default|EN|and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again,
data/example/wavs/7450.wav|EN-default|EN|Why, what on earth does this mean, John?
data/example/wavs/7451.wav|EN-default|EN|waiting for the coming of its occupant.
data/example/wavs/7452.wav|EN-default|EN|They made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen.
data/example/wavs/7453.wav|EN-default|EN|and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.
data/example/wavs/7454.wav|EN-default|EN|And why should he possess so much influence over her?
data/example/wavs/7455.wav|EN-default|EN|and this he placed upon the bed beside him.
data/example/wavs/7456.wav|EN-default|EN|It is our task to find that out.
data/example/wavs/7457.wav|EN-default|EN|Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,

data/example/wavs/7460.wav|EN-default|EN|when the wife tried to force her way up.

data/example/wavs/7470.wav|EN-default|EN|or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopedia Britannica.

data/example/wavs/7472.wav|EN-default|EN|bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache.
data/example/wavs/7473.wav|EN-default|EN|I imagine in which you were interested.
data/example/wavs/7474.wav|EN-default|EN|The paper was made in Bohemia.

data/example/wavs/7476.wav|EN-default|EN|Why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms?
data/example/wavs/7477.wav|EN-default|EN|seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable,

data/example/wavs/7497.wav|EN-default|EN|He kept on worrying her until she got

data/example/wavs/7503.wav|EN-default|EN|Grit in a sensitive instrument
data/example/wavs/7504.wav|EN-default|EN|He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
data/example/wavs/7505.wav|EN-default|EN|We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.
data/example/wavs/7506.wav|EN-default|EN|And not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action.
data/example/wavs/7507.wav|EN-default|EN|and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back.
data/example/wavs/7508.wav|EN-default|EN|Whatever he wanted, he must have.
data/example/wavs/7509.wav|EN-default|EN|was helping a boy to put up the shutters.
data/example/wavs/7510.wav|EN-default|EN|I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.
data/example/wavs/7511.wav|EN-default|EN|Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous
data/example/wavs/7512.wav|EN-default|EN|but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him.
data/example/wavs/7513.wav|EN-default|EN|and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor.
data/example/wavs/7514.wav|EN-default|EN|there were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve,
data/example/wavs/7515.wav|EN-default|EN|where a few lights still glimmered in the window.
data/example/wavs/7516.wav|EN-default|EN|which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling.
data/example/wavs/7517.wav|EN-default|EN|but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for color.
data/example/wavs/7518.wav|EN-default|EN|I warn you that they are very incomplete.
data/example/wavs/7519.wav|EN-default|EN|and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.
data/example/wavs/7520.wav|EN-default|EN|twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk.
data/example/wavs/7521.wav|EN-default|EN|and so too thinks my little mary.
data/example/wavs/7522.wav|EN-default|EN|the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of
data/example/wavs/7523.wav|EN-default|EN|There are rumours of foul play in the matter.
data/example/wavs/7524.wav|EN-default|EN|and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.
data/example/wavs/7525.wav|EN-default|EN|you can easily imagine Mr. Holmes
data/example/wavs/7526.wav|EN-default|EN|was dressed in, etc., etc.
data/example/wavs/7527.wav|EN-default|EN|I've had enough of you and your
data/example/wavs/7528.wav|EN-default|EN|filled with most maddening doubts and fears,
data/example/wavs/7529.wav|EN-default|EN|golden bar of light shot out in our direction.
data/example/wavs/7530.wav|EN-default|EN|and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his great-coat.
data/example/wavs/7531.wav|EN-default|EN|You dig Fuller's earth in the house?
data/example/wavs/7532.wav|EN-default|EN|with a quick little questioning glance from his small, fat and circled eyes.
data/example/wavs/7533.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is an advertisement which will interest you.
data/example/wavs/7534.wav|EN-default|EN|Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage,
data/example/wavs/7535.wav|EN-default|EN|I had just finished my tea when he returned.
data/example/wavs/7536.wav|EN-default|EN|when my way led me through Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/7537.wav|EN-default|EN|as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father.
data/example/wavs/7538.wav|EN-default|EN|And I think that your breakfast has completed the cure.
data/example/wavs/7539.wav|EN-default|EN|throbbed with dull persistence.
data/example/wavs/7540.wav|EN-default|EN|threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it.
data/example/wavs/7541.wav|EN-default|EN|and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
data/example/wavs/7542.wav|EN-default|EN|by the fact that our door had been suddenly
data/example/wavs/7543.wav|EN-default|EN|There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.
data/example/wavs/7544.wav|EN-default|EN|I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
data/example/wavs/7545.wav|EN-default|EN|How cruelly I have misjudged him!
data/example/wavs/7546.wav|EN-default|EN|I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red.
data/example/wavs/7547.wav|EN-default|EN|but they all open out into the same corridor.
data/example/wavs/7548.wav|EN-default|EN|And he misses me so if I leave him.
data/example/wavs/7549.wav|EN-default|EN|cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
data/example/wavs/7550.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.
data/example/wavs/7551.wav|EN-default|EN|quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
data/example/wavs/7552.wav|EN-default|EN|and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.
data/example/wavs/7553.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair, with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion.
data/example/wavs/7554.wav|EN-default|EN|was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men
data/example/wavs/7555.wav|EN-default|EN|The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast,
data/example/wavs/7556.wav|EN-default|EN|Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?
data/example/wavs/7557.wav|EN-default|EN|which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat.
data/example/wavs/7558.wav|EN-default|EN|like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul.
data/example/wavs/7559.wav|EN-default|EN|A few country carts were stirring,
data/example/wavs/7560.wav|EN-default|EN|for they had covered their traces in a way that would have been
data/example/wavs/7561.wav|EN-default|EN|walking up and down on the other side of the room,
data/example/wavs/7562.wav|EN-default|EN|and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
data/example/wavs/7563.wav|EN-default|EN|there can be no doubt that the probability

data/example/wavs/7565.wav|EN-default|EN|and the conversation soon flagged.
data/example/wavs/7566.wav|EN-default|EN|of the American Encyclopedia of the Scriptures.
data/example/wavs/7567.wav|EN-default|EN|We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.
data/example/wavs/7568.wav|EN-default|EN|I would have given it up in despair.
data/example/wavs/7569.wav|EN-default|EN|so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the morning.
data/example/wavs/7570.wav|EN-default|EN|and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand,
data/example/wavs/7571.wav|EN-default|EN|to work out the case in his interest.
data/example/wavs/7572.wav|EN-default|EN|as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
data/example/wavs/7573.wav|EN-default|EN|and from that time I have not sat again in the window,
data/example/wavs/7574.wav|EN-default|EN|Handsome Cab drove up to Briny Lodge.
data/example/wavs/7575.wav|EN-default|EN|That second window is the one that I jumped from.
data/example/wavs/7576.wav|EN-default|EN|There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again.
data/example/wavs/7577.wav|EN-default|EN|rattling away to Paddington Station.
data/example/wavs/7578.wav|EN-default|EN|Atkinson Brothers at Trincomalee.
data/example/wavs/7579.wav|EN-default|EN|Jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.
data/example/wavs/7580.wav|EN-default|EN|He is sure to keep an eye on the papers.
data/example/wavs/7581.wav|EN-default|EN|and it is also true that the initials hb
data/example/wavs/7582.wav|EN-default|EN|That represents the last time that the Colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.
data/example/wavs/7583.wav|EN-default|EN|I was shaken, but not hurt by the fall, so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run.
data/example/wavs/7584.wav|EN-default|EN|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/7585.wav|EN-default|EN|and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
data/example/wavs/7586.wav|EN-default|EN|suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone
data/example/wavs/7587.wav|EN-default|EN|and which lured her within their reach.
data/example/wavs/7588.wav|EN-default|EN|I rapidly threw on my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room.
data/example/wavs/7589.wav|EN-default|EN|I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred.
data/example/wavs/7590.wav|EN-default|EN|until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration
data/example/wavs/7591.wav|EN-default|EN|and crawled swiftly backward and forward,
data/example/wavs/7592.wav|EN-default|EN|who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean.
data/example/wavs/7593.wav|EN-default|EN|It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement.
data/example/wavs/7594.wav|EN-default|EN|His name is Vincent Spaulding.
data/example/wavs/7595.wav|EN-default|EN|in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.
data/example/wavs/7596.wav|EN-default|EN|Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.
data/example/wavs/7597.wav|EN-default|EN|and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.
data/example/wavs/7598.wav|EN-default|EN|How could it be that it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?
data/example/wavs/7599.wav|EN-default|EN|A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.
data/example/wavs/7600.wav|EN-default|EN|you may know the strict principles of her family.
data/example/wavs/7601.wav|EN-default|EN|and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
data/example/wavs/7602.wav|EN-default|EN|We will begin another investigation.
data/example/wavs/7603.wav|EN-default|EN|and it could not be more than thirty feet down.
data/example/wavs/7604.wav|EN-default|EN|that I make a mistake in explaining.
data/example/wavs/7605.wav|EN-default|EN|or the grace and kindliness
data/example/wavs/7606.wav|EN-default|EN|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/7607.wav|EN-default|EN|and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair,
data/example/wavs/7608.wav|EN-default|EN|that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastle's hands,
data/example/wavs/7609.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force.
data/example/wavs/7610.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall now continue my investigations outside.
data/example/wavs/7611.wav|EN-default|EN|Why shouldn't we be married right away, then?
data/example/wavs/7612.wav|EN-default|EN|and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.
data/example/wavs/7613.wav|EN-default|EN|Nothing had been said during our drive but the high, thin breathing of our new companion,
data/example/wavs/7614.wav|EN-default|EN|feeling as flattered as any young man would at such a distress.
data/example/wavs/7615.wav|EN-default|EN|his extreme love of solitude in england
data/example/wavs/7616.wav|EN-default|EN|and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
data/example/wavs/7617.wav|EN-default|EN|and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.
data/example/wavs/7618.wav|EN-default|EN|for I was newly come back from a weary day.
data/example/wavs/7619.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper.
data/example/wavs/7620.wav|EN-default|EN|and that she no longer desired his attentions.
data/example/wavs/7621.wav|EN-default|EN|i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter
data/example/wavs/7622.wav|EN-default|EN|though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.
data/example/wavs/7623.wav|EN-default|EN|no suggestive detail which might help us.
data/example/wavs/7624.wav|EN-default|EN|They drove away in different directions.
data/example/wavs/7625.wav|EN-default|EN|and I to find an enemy.
data/example/wavs/7626.wav|EN-default|EN|and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
data/example/wavs/7627.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson.
data/example/wavs/7628.wav|EN-default|EN|Presently he came to himself once more.
data/example/wavs/7629.wav|EN-default|EN|When my father took over the Horsham property,
data/example/wavs/7630.wav|EN-default|EN|I found my father expiring upon the ground.
data/example/wavs/7631.wav|EN-default|EN|With a nod, he vanished into the bedroom.
data/example/wavs/7632.wav|EN-default|EN|our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
data/example/wavs/7633.wav|EN-default|EN|Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?
data/example/wavs/7634.wav|EN-default|EN|You want to go home, no doubt, doctor?'
data/example/wavs/7635.wav|EN-default|EN|but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.
data/example/wavs/7636.wav|EN-default|EN|He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,
data/example/wavs/7637.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall certainly do as you advise.
data/example/wavs/7638.wav|EN-default|EN|Your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands.
data/example/wavs/7639.wav|EN-default|EN|I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more details.
data/example/wavs/7640.wav|EN-default|EN|I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.
data/example/wavs/7641.wav|EN-default|EN|and I was aware, more than once, when I glanced in his direction,
data/example/wavs/7642.wav|EN-default|EN|He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.
data/example/wavs/7643.wav|EN-default|EN|and she had no just cause of complaint against me,
data/example/wavs/7644.wav|EN-default|EN|Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
data/example/wavs/7645.wav|EN-default|EN|I have already arranged what is to occur.
data/example/wavs/7646.wav|EN-default|EN|which might seem trivial to another,
data/example/wavs/7647.wav|EN-default|EN|who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill.
data/example/wavs/7648.wav|EN-default|EN|It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Edler.
data/example/wavs/7649.wav|EN-default|EN|I think myself that it is a page from some private diary.
data/example/wavs/7650.wav|EN-default|EN|while she held a candle in her right.
data/example/wavs/7651.wav|EN-default|EN|a gentleman named Hosmer Angel.
data/example/wavs/7652.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not worth your while to wait.
data/example/wavs/7653.wav|EN-default|EN|but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room.
data/example/wavs/7654.wav|EN-default|EN|And what conclusions did the coroner come to?
data/example/wavs/7655.wav|EN-default|EN|all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
data/example/wavs/7656.wav|EN-default|EN|For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand.
data/example/wavs/7657.wav|EN-default|EN|Whom have I the honour to address?
data/example/wavs/7658.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, our little place is quite out in the country.
data/example/wavs/7659.wav|EN-default|EN|and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.
data/example/wavs/7660.wav|EN-default|EN|He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds, gazing down into the dull,
data/example/wavs/7661.wav|EN-default|EN|though both the McCarthy's were fond of sport,
data/example/wavs/7662.wav|EN-default|EN|where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting.
data/example/wavs/7663.wav|EN-default|EN|So I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
data/example/wavs/7664.wav|EN-default|EN|and whose residence is near Horsham.
data/example/wavs/7665.wav|EN-default|EN|as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.
data/example/wavs/7666.wav|EN-default|EN|But since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side,
data/example/wavs/7667.wav|EN-default|EN|421 pennies.
data/example/wavs/7668.wav|EN-default|EN|The case has been an interesting one.
data/example/wavs/7669.wav|EN-default|EN|but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.
data/example/wavs/7670.wav|EN-default|EN|but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
data/example/wavs/7671.wav|EN-default|EN|I had seen little of Holmes lately.
data/example/wavs/7672.wav|EN-default|EN|and my poor little reputation such as it is
data/example/wavs/7673.wav|EN-default|EN|I love and am loved by a better man than he.
data/example/wavs/7674.wav|EN-default|EN|You made me reveal what you wanted to know.
data/example/wavs/7675.wav|EN-default|EN|This is wanting in the police report
data/example/wavs/7676.wav|EN-default|EN|his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.
data/example/wavs/7677.wav|EN-default|EN|but that the one always appeared when the other was away,
data/example/wavs/7678.wav|EN-default|EN|and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
data/example/wavs/7679.wav|EN-default|EN|calling loudly for my stepfather,
data/example/wavs/7680.wav|EN-default|EN|seaports, that the writer was on board of a ship.
data/example/wavs/7681.wav|EN-default|EN|and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abode.
data/example/wavs/7682.wav|EN-default|EN|Let us now explore the parts which lie.
data/example/wavs/7683.wav|EN-default|EN|I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.
data/example/wavs/7684.wav|EN-default|EN|is acting already in the matter.
data/example/wavs/7685.wav|EN-default|EN|But there is a cheetah and a baboon.
data/example/wavs/7686.wav|EN-default|EN|is a man of temperate habits.
data/example/wavs/7687.wav|EN-default|EN|We shall then look thoroughly into the affair.
data/example/wavs/7688.wav|EN-default|EN|If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?
data/example/wavs/7689.wav|EN-default|EN|He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.
data/example/wavs/7690.wav|EN-default|EN|And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?
data/example/wavs/7691.wav|EN-default|EN|for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years
data/example/wavs/7692.wav|EN-default|EN|I tossed them all aside and lay listless.
data/example/wavs/7693.wav|EN-default|EN|We have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police.
data/example/wavs/7694.wav|EN-default|EN|and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane.
data/example/wavs/7695.wav|EN-default|EN|He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
data/example/wavs/7696.wav|EN-default|EN|just a little too theoretical and fantastic.
data/example/wavs/7697.wav|EN-default|EN|and had this unfortunate man arrested.
data/example/wavs/7698.wav|EN-default|EN|I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of
data/example/wavs/7699.wav|EN-default|EN|You and your Confederate Cusack
data/example/wavs/7700.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet when I spoke to her of the matter,
data/example/wavs/7701.wav|EN-default|EN|this young man says is true.
data/example/wavs/7702.wav|EN-default|EN|Neither house nor garden were to be seen.
data/example/wavs/7703.wav|EN-default|EN|Eight weeks passed away like this,
data/example/wavs/7704.wav|EN-default|EN|then suddenly realizing the exposure,
data/example/wavs/7705.wav|EN-default|EN|and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea-wave.
data/example/wavs/7706.wav|EN-default|EN|I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible.
data/example/wavs/7707.wav|EN-default|EN|The advance was a great convenience.
data/example/wavs/7708.wav|EN-default|EN|When the inspector and a constable entered the house,
data/example/wavs/7709.wav|EN-default|EN|that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections.
data/example/wavs/7710.wav|EN-default|EN|showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time,
data/example/wavs/7711.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been making a fool of myself.
data/example/wavs/7712.wav|EN-default|EN|of the man, of the woman, of the servants.
data/example/wavs/7713.wav|EN-default|EN|successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds
data/example/wavs/7714.wav|EN-default|EN|instantly put themselves in communication with the police,
data/example/wavs/7715.wav|EN-default|EN|and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.
data/example/wavs/7716.wav|EN-default|EN|and the usual symptom is a broken bell-wire.
data/example/wavs/7717.wav|EN-default|EN|and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
data/example/wavs/7718.wav|EN-default|EN|whose name has not been ascertained,
data/example/wavs/7719.wav|EN-default|EN|I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make
data/example/wavs/7720.wav|EN-default|EN|There's plenty of thread, no doubt.
data/example/wavs/7721.wav|EN-default|EN|and looking eagerly into his face,
data/example/wavs/7722.wav|EN-default|EN|with such skill that nobody can find them.
data/example/wavs/7723.wav|EN-default|EN|is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market.
data/example/wavs/7724.wav|EN-default|EN|before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.
data/example/wavs/7725.wav|EN-default|EN|as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it.
data/example/wavs/7726.wav|EN-default|EN|and we fattened it expressly for you.
data/example/wavs/7727.wav|EN-default|EN|He waved his hands frantically to her.
data/example/wavs/7728.wav|EN-default|EN|the smell of hot metal remained to assure us,
data/example/wavs/7729.wav|EN-default|EN|which leads on to the complete truth.
data/example/wavs/7730.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Shultos.
data/example/wavs/7731.wav|EN-default|EN|and walked down to the Bascom Pool.
data/example/wavs/7732.wav|EN-default|EN|and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople.
data/example/wavs/7733.wav|EN-default|EN|and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it.
data/example/wavs/7734.wav|EN-default|EN|A man entered, who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height.
data/example/wavs/7735.wav|EN-default|EN|And now I beg that you will lay before us.
data/example/wavs/7736.wav|EN-default|EN|and you may expect us early in the afternoon.
data/example/wavs/7737.wav|EN-default|EN|with which she waited upon the injured man.
data/example/wavs/7738.wav|EN-default|EN|I say now, as I said then,
data/example/wavs/7739.wav|EN-default|EN|In that case, I shall continue my professional round.
data/example/wavs/7740.wav|EN-default|EN|He had set the engine at work.

data/example/wavs/7742.wav|EN-default|EN|that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident.
data/example/wavs/7743.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped.
data/example/wavs/7744.wav|EN-default|EN|ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rewcastle.
data/example/wavs/7745.wav|EN-default|EN|in the best laid of human plans
data/example/wavs/7746.wav|EN-default|EN|and rising from the table he retired to his room
data/example/wavs/7747.wav|EN-default|EN|no record of strangers having been seen upon the road.
data/example/wavs/7748.wav|EN-default|EN|It is no wonder that it did not wake you.
data/example/wavs/7749.wav|EN-default|EN|I have no doubt that I am very stupid.
data/example/wavs/7750.wav|EN-default|EN|The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers,
data/example/wavs/7751.wav|EN-default|EN|but I thought it better not to disturb it.
data/example/wavs/7752.wav|EN-default|EN|You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory.
data/example/wavs/7753.wav|EN-default|EN|You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I—'
data/example/wavs/7754.wav|EN-default|EN|stretching along the entire front of the house,
data/example/wavs/7755.wav|EN-default|EN|The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber.
data/example/wavs/7756.wav|EN-default|EN|It is a good seven miles from Eifert Station.
data/example/wavs/7757.wav|EN-default|EN|The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist
data/example/wavs/7758.wav|EN-default|EN|When you combine the ideas of Whistle Sit
data/example/wavs/7759.wav|EN-default|EN|My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end.
data/example/wavs/7760.wav|EN-default|EN|I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers.'
data/example/wavs/7761.wav|EN-default|EN|If it had been written straight off and then blotted,
data/example/wavs/7762.wav|EN-default|EN|Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee.
data/example/wavs/7763.wav|EN-default|EN|but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there,
data/example/wavs/7764.wav|EN-default|EN|all has turned out splendidly.
data/example/wavs/7765.wav|EN-default|EN|They have, however, allowed me a policeman.
data/example/wavs/7766.wav|EN-default|EN|of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.
data/example/wavs/7767.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, when he had closed the door behind him.
data/example/wavs/7768.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, a white-brimmed straw hat,
data/example/wavs/7769.wav|EN-default|EN|and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom.
data/example/wavs/7770.wav|EN-default|EN|Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.
data/example/wavs/7771.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not a common experience among employers in this age.
data/example/wavs/7772.wav|EN-default|EN|which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities
data/example/wavs/7773.wav|EN-default|EN|And what are the very peculiar words of the dying woman?
data/example/wavs/7774.wav|EN-default|EN|Was the remainder of the cornet at all injured?
data/example/wavs/7775.wav|EN-default|EN|and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?
data/example/wavs/7776.wav|EN-default|EN|working through generations
data/example/wavs/7777.wav|EN-default|EN|began talking rather to himself, as it seemed.
data/example/wavs/7778.wav|EN-default|EN|That's all I have in the house for...
data/example/wavs/7779.wav|EN-default|EN|But you would not advise me to refuse?
data/example/wavs/7780.wav|EN-default|EN|which he enlarged at the time of the invention of
data/example/wavs/7781.wav|EN-default|EN|Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
data/example/wavs/7782.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought of the salt that I had been working upon.
data/example/wavs/7783.wav|EN-default|EN|and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
data/example/wavs/7784.wav|EN-default|EN|I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it.
data/example/wavs/7785.wav|EN-default|EN|There's never very much to do of a morning.
data/example/wavs/7786.wav|EN-default|EN|said Jones in his consequential way.
data/example/wavs/7787.wav|EN-default|EN|some preposterous practical joke.
data/example/wavs/7788.wav|EN-default|EN|and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol-shots.
data/example/wavs/7789.wav|EN-default|EN|I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully,
data/example/wavs/7790.wav|EN-default|EN|The fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight.
data/example/wavs/7791.wav|EN-default|EN|When did you first meet Miss Hattie Duran?
data/example/wavs/7792.wav|EN-default|EN|coat was buttoned right up in front
data/example/wavs/7793.wav|EN-default|EN|and indeed he has little to do with my story.
data/example/wavs/7794.wav|EN-default|EN|it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack
data/example/wavs/7795.wav|EN-default|EN|stretching from the road to the kitchen door.
data/example/wavs/7796.wav|EN-default|EN|we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grouse.
data/example/wavs/7797.wav|EN-default|EN|and came up by leaps and bounds.
data/example/wavs/7798.wav|EN-default|EN|He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said,
data/example/wavs/7799.wav|EN-default|EN|you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears.
data/example/wavs/7800.wav|EN-default|EN|Hence those vows of fidelity
data/example/wavs/7801.wav|EN-default|EN|place we want must be somewhere near that line.
data/example/wavs/7802.wav|EN-default|EN|I would give my fortune to have them back.
data/example/wavs/7803.wav|EN-default|EN|I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road.
data/example/wavs/7804.wav|EN-default|EN|where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey Lane.
data/example/wavs/7805.wav|EN-default|EN|There was a little passage in front of me.
data/example/wavs/7806.wav|EN-default|EN|BUT SOON HE FOUND THAT THAT WOULD NOT ANSWER FOREVER.
data/example/wavs/7807.wav|EN-default|EN|You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
data/example/wavs/7808.wav|EN-default|EN|Then her father thought it time to put a stop on it.
data/example/wavs/7809.wav|EN-default|EN|I've heard that voice before.
data/example/wavs/7810.wav|EN-default|EN|and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning.
data/example/wavs/7811.wav|EN-default|EN|and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius.
data/example/wavs/7812.wav|EN-default|EN|and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.
data/example/wavs/7813.wav|EN-default|EN|neither sickness nor business nor anything else.
data/example/wavs/7814.wav|EN-default|EN|The country roads seemed to be not very good in that time.
data/example/wavs/7815.wav|EN-default|EN|We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work.
data/example/wavs/7816.wav|EN-default|EN|a man rather over the middle side.
data/example/wavs/7817.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man.
data/example/wavs/7818.wav|EN-default|EN|that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man.
data/example/wavs/7819.wav|EN-default|EN|but had refused to credit that it was his mistress.
data/example/wavs/7820.wav|EN-default|EN|I think, Watson, that you have put on—
data/example/wavs/7821.wav|EN-default|EN|and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.
data/example/wavs/7822.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not part of my duties to my client.
data/example/wavs/7823.wav|EN-default|EN|I was arrested as his murderer.
data/example/wavs/7824.wav|EN-default|EN|I fear that you will find it very slow.
data/example/wavs/7825.wav|EN-default|EN|You are doing what you can for him and for me.
data/example/wavs/7826.wav|EN-default|EN|by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
data/example/wavs/7827.wav|EN-default|EN|but no trace of them could be found.
data/example/wavs/7828.wav|EN-default|EN|for we must have one to give to this gentleman.
data/example/wavs/7829.wav|EN-default|EN|but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer.
data/example/wavs/7830.wav|EN-default|EN|On the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open.
data/example/wavs/7831.wav|EN-default|EN|but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us.
data/example/wavs/7832.wav|EN-default|EN|In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
data/example/wavs/7833.wav|EN-default|EN|My companion sat in the front of the trap.
data/example/wavs/7834.wav|EN-default|EN|A row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs.
data/example/wavs/7835.wav|EN-default|EN|with a kind of question in his eyes.
data/example/wavs/7836.wav|EN-default|EN|but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen
data/example/wavs/7837.wav|EN-default|EN|took to the system of imprisonment,
data/example/wavs/7838.wav|EN-default|EN|Her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path.
data/example/wavs/7839.wav|EN-default|EN|Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life,
data/example/wavs/7840.wav|EN-default|EN|he became the terror of the village.
data/example/wavs/7841.wav|EN-default|EN|and she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
data/example/wavs/7842.wav|EN-default|EN|As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone,
data/example/wavs/7843.wav|EN-default|EN|So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room,
data/example/wavs/7844.wav|EN-default|EN|which consisted of a single flaming burl.
data/example/wavs/7845.wav|EN-default|EN|our visitor bore every mark of being an average
data/example/wavs/7846.wav|EN-default|EN|and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
data/example/wavs/7847.wav|EN-default|EN|but I think I have the key of the affair now.
data/example/wavs/7848.wav|EN-default|EN|but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
data/example/wavs/7849.wav|EN-default|EN|From what I have seen of the lady, she seems indeed
data/example/wavs/7850.wav|EN-default|EN|but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.
data/example/wavs/7851.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought I'd bring him round myself.
data/example/wavs/7852.wav|EN-default|EN|we have retained these things for some days,
data/example/wavs/7853.wav|EN-default|EN|for standing in the way of anything of the sort.
data/example/wavs/7854.wav|EN-default|EN|I must be dull indeed.
data/example/wavs/7855.wav|EN-default|EN|There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.
data/example/wavs/7856.wav|EN-default|EN|Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?

data/example/wavs/7860.wav|EN-default|EN|But as there are some thousands of bakers,
data/example/wavs/7861.wav|EN-default|EN|it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.
data/example/wavs/7862.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall never let it drop until the gems are found.
data/example/wavs/7863.wav|EN-default|EN|to obey any little commands my wife might give.
data/example/wavs/7864.wav|EN-default|EN|as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall,
data/example/wavs/7865.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sorry to hear you say that.
data/example/wavs/7866.wav|EN-default|EN|and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.
data/example/wavs/7867.wav|EN-default|EN|that I am an orphan and a bachelor.
data/example/wavs/7868.wav|EN-default|EN|and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the duck.
data/example/wavs/7869.wav|EN-default|EN|while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing.
data/example/wavs/7870.wav|EN-default|EN|but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter.
data/example/wavs/7871.wav|EN-default|EN|and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined
data/example/wavs/7872.wav|EN-default|EN|He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly.
data/example/wavs/7873.wav|EN-default|EN|All the morning he was saying to me that
data/example/wavs/7874.wav|EN-default|EN|When I saw how many were waiting,
data/example/wavs/7875.wav|EN-default|EN|Only three minutes or it won't be legal.
data/example/wavs/7876.wav|EN-default|EN|It is very ingenious.
data/example/wavs/7877.wav|EN-default|EN|and afterwards i shall walk down to doctor's commons
data/example/wavs/7878.wav|EN-default|EN|One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five,
data/example/wavs/7879.wav|EN-default|EN|I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife

data/example/wavs/7881.wav|EN-default|EN|He was not a popular man.
data/example/wavs/7882.wav|EN-default|EN|He asked at last, pointing to a thick

data/example/wavs/7884.wav|EN-default|EN|Mother said he was quite right to make me swear.
data/example/wavs/7885.wav|EN-default|EN|beckoning to her from a second-floor window.
data/example/wavs/7886.wav|EN-default|EN|so that he was left in possession of the field of

data/example/wavs/7888.wav|EN-default|EN|In my position you can readily understand that it is
data/example/wavs/7889.wav|EN-default|EN|I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly
data/example/wavs/7890.wav|EN-default|EN|I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
data/example/wavs/7891.wav|EN-default|EN|was Under-Secretary for the Colonies in a late administration.
data/example/wavs/7892.wav|EN-default|EN|threw myself screaming against the door.
data/example/wavs/7893.wav|EN-default|EN|You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.
data/example/wavs/7894.wav|EN-default|EN|and fastened at the other with stout cord.
data/example/wavs/7895.wav|EN-default|EN|Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly
data/example/wavs/7896.wav|EN-default|EN|do so I came straight to you.
data/example/wavs/7897.wav|EN-default|EN|Was he in favour of such a union?
data/example/wavs/7898.wav|EN-default|EN|when they talked of marrying within the week,
data/example/wavs/7899.wav|EN-default|EN|with a pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid,
data/example/wavs/7900.wav|EN-default|EN|He walked swiftly and in silence for some minutes.
data/example/wavs/7901.wav|EN-default|EN|and if she died from some sudden fright.
data/example/wavs/7902.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall want your cooperation.
data/example/wavs/7903.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again.
data/example/wavs/7904.wav|EN-default|EN|neutral-tinted London street.
data/example/wavs/7905.wav|EN-default|EN|which my special knowledge of tobacco esches,
data/example/wavs/7906.wav|EN-default|EN|If the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you.
data/example/wavs/7907.wav|EN-default|EN|That circle is drawn at a radius of 10 miles from the village.
data/example/wavs/7908.wav|EN-default|EN|as it would give them two days for their escape.
data/example/wavs/7909.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, I know that he is right.
data/example/wavs/7910.wav|EN-default|EN|and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point.
data/example/wavs/7911.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant,
data/example/wavs/7912.wav|EN-default|EN|there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.
data/example/wavs/7913.wav|EN-default|EN|During that time I have lived happily at Horsham.

data/example/wavs/7915.wav|EN-default|EN|hosted today in Gravesend by a fellow with a dirty thumb.
data/example/wavs/7916.wav|EN-default|EN|and he was less inclined for any sort of society.
data/example/wavs/7917.wav|EN-default|EN|Then there are successive entries that

data/example/wavs/7922.wav|EN-default|EN|A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal.
data/example/wavs/7923.wav|EN-default|EN|and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof.
data/example/wavs/7924.wav|EN-default|EN|whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
data/example/wavs/7925.wav|EN-default|EN|we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
data/example/wavs/7926.wav|EN-default|EN|for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott
data/example/wavs/7927.wav|EN-default|EN|One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly,

data/example/wavs/7929.wav|EN-default|EN|when he came to the high road at the other end,
data/example/wavs/7930.wav|EN-default|EN|Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?
data/example/wavs/7931.wav|EN-default|EN|and as he is a piteous spectacle,
data/example/wavs/7932.wav|EN-default|EN|and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
data/example/wavs/7933.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over.
data/example/wavs/7934.wav|EN-default|EN|His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride.
data/example/wavs/7935.wav|EN-default|EN|was because I was concerned in it.
data/example/wavs/7936.wav|EN-default|EN|and a square pierced bit of metal
data/example/wavs/7937.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be exceedingly glad to have a little time.

data/example/wavs/7941.wav|EN-default|EN|and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
data/example/wavs/7942.wav|EN-default|EN|two fills of shag tobacco,

data/example/wavs/7945.wav|EN-default|EN|Our quest is practically finished.
data/example/wavs/7946.wav|EN-default|EN|and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact.
data/example/wavs/7947.wav|EN-default|EN|it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station.
data/example/wavs/7948.wav|EN-default|EN|that I was able to avert another public exposure.
data/example/wavs/7949.wav|EN-default|EN|was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg,
data/example/wavs/7950.wav|EN-default|EN|like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.

data/example/wavs/8358.wav|EN-default|EN|He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up.
data/example/wavs/8359.wav|EN-default|EN|Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour.

data/example/wavs/8361.wav|EN-default|EN|The thought had hardly flashed through my mind.
data/example/wavs/8362.wav|EN-default|EN|which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,

data/example/wavs/8364.wav|EN-default|EN|He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/8365.wav|EN-default|EN|three have been entirely free of any legal crime.

data/example/wavs/8368.wav|EN-default|EN|when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind,
data/example/wavs/8369.wav|EN-default|EN|like untamed beasts in a cage.
data/example/wavs/8370.wav|EN-default|EN|We never thought that she would have been so cute.
data/example/wavs/8371.wav|EN-default|EN|He continued, disregarding my remonstrance.
data/example/wavs/8372.wav|EN-default|EN|as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.
data/example/wavs/8373.wav|EN-default|EN|and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points,
data/example/wavs/8374.wav|EN-default|EN|As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet,
data/example/wavs/8375.wav|EN-default|EN|There was no furniture save a little pallet.
data/example/wavs/8376.wav|EN-default|EN|We had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind.
data/example/wavs/8377.wav|EN-default|EN|Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
data/example/wavs/8378.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length.
data/example/wavs/8379.wav|EN-default|EN|When I have spun the web, they may take the flies, but not before.

data/example/wavs/8382.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house.
data/example/wavs/8383.wav|EN-default|EN|dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate.
data/example/wavs/8384.wav|EN-default|EN|We waited for him to step out.
data/example/wavs/8385.wav|EN-default|EN|and he left a tidy business behind him.
data/example/wavs/8386.wav|EN-default|EN|difficult to post a letter unobserved.
data/example/wavs/8387.wav|EN-default|EN|and away we dashed down the London Road.
data/example/wavs/8388.wav|EN-default|EN|The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked.
data/example/wavs/8389.wav|EN-default|EN|I had formed my conclusions as to the case
data/example/wavs/8390.wav|EN-default|EN|I was leaning against the wall at the time.

data/example/wavs/8395.wav|EN-default|EN|one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.
data/example/wavs/8396.wav|EN-default|EN|heard a sound which set my heart into my mouth.
data/example/wavs/8397.wav|EN-default|EN|I may want your help, and so may he.
data/example/wavs/8398.wav|EN-default|EN|They each led into an empty room.

data/example/wavs/8401.wav|EN-default|EN|let me introduce you to Mr. Merriweather.
data/example/wavs/8402.wav|EN-default|EN|As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible.
data/example/wavs/8403.wav|EN-default|EN|He walked swiftly round from one to the other.
data/example/wavs/8404.wav|EN-default|EN|some little distance down Threadneedle Street.
data/example/wavs/8405.wav|EN-default|EN|but he still refused to raise his eyes.
data/example/wavs/8406.wav|EN-default|EN|I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase.
data/example/wavs/8407.wav|EN-default|EN|Come now, we shall see who agrees with you.

data/example/wavs/8410.wav|EN-default|EN|We must try the simplest means first.
data/example/wavs/8411.wav|EN-default|EN|and a little bend of the knees as he walked.
data/example/wavs/8412.wav|EN-default|EN|Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet,
data/example/wavs/8413.wav|EN-default|EN|that we cannot risk the presence of a light.
data/example/wavs/8414.wav|EN-default|EN|his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
data/example/wavs/8415.wav|EN-default|EN|though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb.
data/example/wavs/8416.wav|EN-default|EN|by a very heavy and sharp instrument.
data/example/wavs/8417.wav|EN-default|EN|for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet.
data/example/wavs/8418.wav|EN-default|EN|but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.
data/example/wavs/8419.wav|EN-default|EN|I assure you that it is not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance.
data/example/wavs/8420.wav|EN-default|EN|In the surgeon's deposition it was stated,

data/example/wavs/8426.wav|EN-default|EN|I found myself inside the bedroom.

data/example/wavs/8428.wav|EN-default|EN|and I think I shall just treat myself to...
data/example/wavs/8429.wav|EN-default|EN|I had been away from home for three days at Bristol.
data/example/wavs/8430.wav|EN-default|EN|As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.
data/example/wavs/8431.wav|EN-default|EN|The habit grew upon him, as I understand.
data/example/wavs/8432.wav|EN-default|EN|and that the play will be more exciting.
data/example/wavs/8433.wav|EN-default|EN|though we knew that he had not retired to rest,
data/example/wavs/8434.wav|EN-default|EN|We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.
data/example/wavs/8435.wav|EN-default|EN|I rushed forward and fell down.
data/example/wavs/8436.wav|EN-default|EN|They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door.
data/example/wavs/8437.wav|EN-default|EN|and that he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.

data/example/wavs/8443.wav|EN-default|EN|and then closing it once more, hurry back to her room.
data/example/wavs/8444.wav|EN-default|EN|Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above.
data/example/wavs/8445.wav|EN-default|EN|and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room.
data/example/wavs/8446.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper.
data/example/wavs/8447.wav|EN-default|EN|for it was that of none other than

data/example/wavs/8468.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner.
data/example/wavs/8469.wav|EN-default|EN|which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes,
data/example/wavs/8470.wav|EN-default|EN|And then afterwards they remembered us.

data/example/wavs/8472.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?'
data/example/wavs/8473.wav|EN-default|EN|A few moments later he was in our room.
data/example/wavs/8474.wav|EN-default|EN|He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

data/example/wavs/8489.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought there might be some weapon or other trace.
data/example/wavs/8490.wav|EN-default|EN|but this horrible man confessed to having

data/example/wavs/8493.wav|EN-default|EN|The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish.
data/example/wavs/8494.wav|EN-default|EN|but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort.

data/example/wavs/8554.wav|EN-default|EN|Do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.

data/example/wavs/8556.wav|EN-default|EN|If I may give an opinion.
data/example/wavs/8557.wav|EN-default|EN|and took down a life-preserver from the wall.
data/example/wavs/8558.wav|EN-default|EN|the whole business was still confused and grotesque.
data/example/wavs/8559.wav|EN-default|EN|This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?'

data/example/wavs/8561.wav|EN-default|EN|And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill.
data/example/wavs/8562.wav|EN-default|EN|and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.
data/example/wavs/8563.wav|EN-default|EN|When our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others,
data/example/wavs/8564.wav|EN-default|EN|doubtless among the dregs of the dock.

data/example/wavs/8573.wav|EN-default|EN|excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.
data/example/wavs/8574.wav|EN-default|EN|Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.
data/example/wavs/8575.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew that my own fate was sealed.

data/example/wavs/8577.wav|EN-default|EN|who was very peculiar in his ways.
data/example/wavs/8578.wav|EN-default|EN|I was also aware of that.
data/example/wavs/8579.wav|EN-default|EN|he appeared to be in a great hurry.

data/example/wavs/8582.wav|EN-default|EN|There came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back.
data/example/wavs/8583.wav|EN-default|EN|clipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers,
data/example/wavs/8584.wav|EN-default|EN|He drew over the lamp and examined it intently.
data/example/wavs/8585.wav|EN-default|EN|It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
data/example/wavs/8586.wav|EN-default|EN|He had made a very considerable fortune in the States.
data/example/wavs/8587.wav|EN-default|EN|Why, I have lost four pound a week.
data/example/wavs/8588.wav|EN-default|EN|For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
data/example/wavs/8589.wav|EN-default|EN|there was nothing else save the five dried pips.
data/example/wavs/8590.wav|EN-default|EN|They are never sold upon hats.
data/example/wavs/8591.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew that it was not you who had brought it down.

data/example/wavs/8593.wav|EN-default|EN|Photography is one of my hobbies.

data/example/wavs/8595.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be glad to know what they would be.
data/example/wavs/8596.wav|EN-default|EN|My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man,
data/example/wavs/8597.wav|EN-default|EN|the young widow of Major General Stoner,
data/example/wavs/8598.wav|EN-default|EN|and a pile of crumpled morning papers.

data/example/wavs/8600.wav|EN-default|EN|replied Lestrade, with some warmth.
data/example/wavs/8601.wav|EN-default|EN|of her resort to her confidential maid,
data/example/wavs/8602.wav|EN-default|EN|and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father.
data/example/wavs/8603.wav|EN-default|EN|for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door.
data/example/wavs/8604.wav|EN-default|EN|and secured at the neck with a brooch.
data/example/wavs/8605.wav|EN-default|EN|it is perhaps less suggestive that it
data/example/wavs/8606.wav|EN-default|EN|My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition.
data/example/wavs/8607.wav|EN-default|EN|It was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
data/example/wavs/8608.wav|EN-default|EN|but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes
data/example/wavs/8609.wav|EN-default|EN|and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures,
data/example/wavs/8610.wav|EN-default|EN|That was the word the man uttered.
data/example/wavs/8611.wav|EN-default|EN|taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs,
data/example/wavs/8612.wav|EN-default|EN|for i had now returned to civil practice.
data/example/wavs/8613.wav|EN-default|EN|He took two swift steps to the whip.
data/example/wavs/8614.wav|EN-default|EN|but has less now than formerly,
data/example/wavs/8615.wav|EN-default|EN|The third on the right is his.
data/example/wavs/8616.wav|EN-default|EN|You have come in by train this morning, I see.
data/example/wavs/8617.wav|EN-default|EN|and any letters of his which you can spare.
data/example/wavs/8618.wav|EN-default|EN|You see that we have been as good as our word.
data/example/wavs/8619.wav|EN-default|EN|At dusk we saw Dr. Grimsby Roylatt drive past.
data/example/wavs/8620.wav|EN-default|EN|Have you heard anything of the case?
data/example/wavs/8621.wav|EN-default|EN|I nodded to show that I had heard.
data/example/wavs/8622.wav|EN-default|EN|Sit down and let us talk it over.
data/example/wavs/8623.wav|EN-default|EN|I could not ask for anything better.
data/example/wavs/8624.wav|EN-default|EN|but his voice was just a little too coaxing.
data/example/wavs/8625.wav|EN-default|EN|The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents.
data/example/wavs/8626.wav|EN-default|EN|for out of these causes which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in,
data/example/wavs/8627.wav|EN-default|EN|and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work.
data/example/wavs/8628.wav|EN-default|EN|It seemed strange talk for a wedding morning.
data/example/wavs/8629.wav|EN-default|EN|Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
data/example/wavs/8630.wav|EN-default|EN|but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
data/example/wavs/8631.wav|EN-default|EN|but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least
data/example/wavs/8632.wav|EN-default|EN|How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses
data/example/wavs/8633.wav|EN-default|EN|to my horror and astonishment
data/example/wavs/8634.wav|EN-default|EN|so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman
data/example/wavs/8635.wav|EN-default|EN|as to his remark about his deserts.
data/example/wavs/8636.wav|EN-default|EN|keenly interested, as I always was,
data/example/wavs/8637.wav|EN-default|EN|kindly look her up in my index-doctor.
data/example/wavs/8638.wav|EN-default|EN|but which have given room for those faculties of deduction

data/example/wavs/8640.wav|EN-default|EN|Both Taller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms.
data/example/wavs/8641.wav|EN-default|EN|and I would rather have my bracelets on him.
data/example/wavs/8642.wav|EN-default|EN|He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect.
data/example/wavs/8643.wav|EN-default|EN|and moving my chair a little sideways,
data/example/wavs/8644.wav|EN-default|EN|and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you.
data/example/wavs/8645.wav|EN-default|EN|because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.
data/example/wavs/8646.wav|EN-default|EN|You have erred, perhaps, in attempting to put colour and life—
data/example/wavs/8647.wav|EN-default|EN|not with the larger, but with the smaller crime.
data/example/wavs/8648.wav|EN-default|EN|since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion.
data/example/wavs/8649.wav|EN-default|EN|Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across.
data/example/wavs/8650.wav|EN-default|EN|he slapped it down upon the table in front of him.
data/example/wavs/8651.wav|EN-default|EN|but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening.
data/example/wavs/8652.wav|EN-default|EN|that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour
data/example/wavs/8653.wav|EN-default|EN|and in a word became what you would call over here
data/example/wavs/8654.wav|EN-default|EN|He went alone at his own request.

data/example/wavs/8659.wav|EN-default|EN|The small boy brought round a small thin volume.
data/example/wavs/8660.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, any old key will fit that.
data/example/wavs/8661.wav|EN-default|EN|He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
data/example/wavs/8662.wav|EN-default|EN|but I have had a very strange experience.
data/example/wavs/8663.wav|EN-default|EN|by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
data/example/wavs/8664.wav|EN-default|EN|A very long and complex story was written in the snow, in front of me.
data/example/wavs/8665.wav|EN-default|EN|with his head sunk upon his breast.
data/example/wavs/8666.wav|EN-default|EN|It is always under the honorable title of

data/example/wavs/8668.wav|EN-default|EN|fully dressed by the side of my bed.
data/example/wavs/8669.wav|EN-default|EN|A worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.
data/example/wavs/8670.wav|EN-default|EN|which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.
data/example/wavs/8671.wav|EN-default|EN|It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall,

data/example/wavs/8674.wav|EN-default|EN|for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.
data/example/wavs/8675.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have more than once taken advantage of it.
data/example/wavs/8676.wav|EN-default|EN|which have been already referred to.

data/example/wavs/8679.wav|EN-default|EN|My companion noiselessly closed the shutters.

data/example/wavs/8689.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with

data/example/wavs/8691.wav|EN-default|EN|and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylett's chamber?
data/example/wavs/8692.wav|EN-default|EN|and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes

data/example/wavs/9176.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.
data/example/wavs/9177.wav|EN-default|EN|I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with some details as to your case.
data/example/wavs/9178.wav|EN-default|EN|and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident
data/example/wavs/9179.wav|EN-default|EN|And what purpose that could answer, I confess, is more than I can imagine.

data/example/wavs/9182.wav|EN-default|EN|He whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words.
data/example/wavs/9183.wav|EN-default|EN|The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner.
data/example/wavs/9184.wav|EN-default|EN|especially as I could not help remarking its beauty.
data/example/wavs/9185.wav|EN-default|EN|and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the dark.
data/example/wavs/9186.wav|EN-default|EN|I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and bizarre.
data/example/wavs/9187.wav|EN-default|EN|I had not an idea who you were when you came in.
data/example/wavs/9188.wav|EN-default|EN|You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.
data/example/wavs/9189.wav|EN-default|EN|and we are to be married in the course of the spring.
data/example/wavs/9190.wav|EN-default|EN|the year after the Franco-Prussian War.
data/example/wavs/9191.wav|EN-default|EN|and found your father fatally injured?
data/example/wavs/9192.wav|EN-default|EN|Returning by the 514 from Cannon Street,
data/example/wavs/9193.wav|EN-default|EN|To the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time.
data/example/wavs/9194.wav|EN-default|EN|There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner.
data/example/wavs/9195.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us.
data/example/wavs/9196.wav|EN-default|EN|does it not strike you as a little singular that this maccarthy
data/example/wavs/9197.wav|EN-default|EN|I determined to start him business for myself.'
data/example/wavs/9198.wav|EN-default|EN|When he told us of a man in a pew,
data/example/wavs/9199.wav|EN-default|EN|knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious.
data/example/wavs/9200.wav|EN-default|EN|On the inside of the cover was a paper label.
data/example/wavs/9201.wav|EN-default|EN|and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.
data/example/wavs/9202.wav|EN-default|EN|but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
data/example/wavs/9203.wav|EN-default|EN|Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly.
data/example/wavs/9204.wav|EN-default|EN|Look at the band of ripped silk and the excellent lining.
data/example/wavs/9205.wav|EN-default|EN|Of these bedrooms, the first is Dr. Roylott's,
data/example/wavs/9206.wav|EN-default|EN|recalled Holmes's surmise as to his habits.
data/example/wavs/9207.wav|EN-default|EN|amazing powers and the use of disguises
data/example/wavs/9208.wav|EN-default|EN|in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.
data/example/wavs/9209.wav|EN-default|EN|was that although he wore some dark
data/example/wavs/9210.wav|EN-default|EN|while I continued to retain the hat
data/example/wavs/9211.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought that he was delirious.
data/example/wavs/9212.wav|EN-default|EN|By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
data/example/wavs/9213.wav|EN-default|EN|so there is little which you need tell me.
data/example/wavs/9214.wav|EN-default|EN|He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away.

data/example/wavs/9219.wav|EN-default|EN|and that therefore I am illegally detained.
data/example/wavs/9220.wav|EN-default|EN|I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner
data/example/wavs/9221.wav|EN-default|EN|Even after I became suspicious,
data/example/wavs/9222.wav|EN-default|EN|He started me off upon the letter A.
data/example/wavs/9223.wav|EN-default|EN|I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room.'
data/example/wavs/9224.wav|EN-default|EN|Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled,
data/example/wavs/9225.wav|EN-default|EN|Can you tell me where it went to?
data/example/wavs/9226.wav|EN-default|EN|You have an answer to everything.
data/example/wavs/9227.wav|EN-default|EN|I have heard of you from Mrs. Ferentosh.
data/example/wavs/9228.wav|EN-default|EN|and a few minutes after I found, rather,
data/example/wavs/9229.wav|EN-default|EN|so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house.
data/example/wavs/9230.wav|EN-default|EN|This is my intimate friend and associate,
data/example/wavs/9231.wav|EN-default|EN|defined my limits in a very precise fashion.
data/example/wavs/9232.wav|EN-default|EN|It may prove to be something of interest, after all.
data/example/wavs/9233.wav|EN-default|EN|and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.
data/example/wavs/9234.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness.
data/example/wavs/9235.wav|EN-default|EN|subsided into a doddering loose-lipped senility.
data/example/wavs/9236.wav|EN-default|EN|glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
data/example/wavs/9237.wav|EN-default|EN|By degrees, Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning.
data/example/wavs/9238.wav|EN-default|EN|In two hours we must be on the scene of action.
data/example/wavs/9239.wav|EN-default|EN|You can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it.
data/example/wavs/9240.wav|EN-default|EN|Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.
data/example/wavs/9241.wav|EN-default|EN|one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England.
data/example/wavs/9242.wav|EN-default|EN|watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope,
data/example/wavs/9243.wav|EN-default|EN|with a hunting crop swinging in his hand.
data/example/wavs/9244.wav|EN-default|EN|Chaffering, I got our stones at one thousand pounds apiece.
data/example/wavs/9245.wav|EN-default|EN|I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when,
data/example/wavs/9246.wav|EN-default|EN|and the only point which remains to be determined
data/example/wavs/9247.wav|EN-default|EN|It appeared to you to be a simple case.
data/example/wavs/9248.wav|EN-default|EN|The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him.
data/example/wavs/9249.wav|EN-default|EN|had to go and inquire as to the address.
data/example/wavs/9250.wav|EN-default|EN|and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the bees before very long.
data/example/wavs/9251.wav|EN-default|EN|and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,
data/example/wavs/9252.wav|EN-default|EN|and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell.
data/example/wavs/9253.wav|EN-default|EN|and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.
data/example/wavs/9254.wav|EN-default|EN|See here, sir, see what my wife found in its crop.
data/example/wavs/9255.wav|EN-default|EN|and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
data/example/wavs/9256.wav|EN-default|EN|but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people.
data/example/wavs/9257.wav|EN-default|EN|I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible.
data/example/wavs/9258.wav|EN-default|EN|all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.
data/example/wavs/9259.wav|EN-default|EN|She came in just now by the back door.
data/example/wavs/9260.wav|EN-default|EN|Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road, we crossed over the river,
data/example/wavs/9261.wav|EN-default|EN|Next Monday I have a large sum due to me.
data/example/wavs/9262.wav|EN-default|EN|and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.
data/example/wavs/9263.wav|EN-default|EN|his legs stretched out in front of him.
data/example/wavs/9264.wav|EN-default|EN|I was at once convinced from what you had told me.
data/example/wavs/9265.wav|EN-default|EN|Let us put it to a practical test.
data/example/wavs/9266.wav|EN-default|EN|in following out those clues
data/example/wavs/9267.wav|EN-default|EN|Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.
data/example/wavs/9268.wav|EN-default|EN|There I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a quiet,
data/example/wavs/9269.wav|EN-default|EN|Within was a small square room,
data/example/wavs/9270.wav|EN-default|EN|could therefore hardly be in the best of training.
data/example/wavs/9271.wav|EN-default|EN|I was half dragged up to the altar.
data/example/wavs/9272.wav|EN-default|EN|and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London.
data/example/wavs/9273.wav|EN-default|EN|uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
data/example/wavs/9274.wav|EN-default|EN|and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb.
data/example/wavs/9275.wav|EN-default|EN|but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways,
data/example/wavs/9276.wav|EN-default|EN|as she swept silently into the room.
data/example/wavs/9277.wav|EN-default|EN|murmured holmes, settling himself down in his arm-chair and closing his eyes.
data/example/wavs/9278.wav|EN-default|EN|I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.
data/example/wavs/9279.wav|EN-default|EN|The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting.
data/example/wavs/9280.wav|EN-default|EN|As we approached, the door flew open.
data/example/wavs/9281.wav|EN-default|EN|that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
data/example/wavs/9282.wav|EN-default|EN|for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell.
data/example/wavs/9283.wav|EN-default|EN|during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction.
data/example/wavs/9284.wav|EN-default|EN|No two of them write exactly alike.
data/example/wavs/9285.wav|EN-default|EN|but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up.
data/example/wavs/9286.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Windebank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves.
data/example/wavs/9287.wav|EN-default|EN|Look at the neat little Hosmer angel at the bottom.
data/example/wavs/9288.wav|EN-default|EN|a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I thought it well to perform myself that night.
data/example/wavs/9289.wav|EN-default|EN|Singularity is almost invariably a clue.
data/example/wavs/9290.wav|EN-default|EN|I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.
data/example/wavs/9291.wav|EN-default|EN|It was all done in an instant.
data/example/wavs/9292.wav|EN-default|EN|It was not until close upon six o'clock
data/example/wavs/9293.wav|EN-default|EN|with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face.
data/example/wavs/9294.wav|EN-default|EN|But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel?
data/example/wavs/9295.wav|EN-default|EN|He is still with you, I presume?'
data/example/wavs/9296.wav|EN-default|EN|to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance,
data/example/wavs/9297.wav|EN-default|EN|This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field,
data/example/wavs/9298.wav|EN-default|EN|being himself not only a very capable performer,
data/example/wavs/9299.wav|EN-default|EN|so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
data/example/wavs/9300.wav|EN-default|EN|This may save us a visit to Brixton Road.
data/example/wavs/9301.wav|EN-default|EN|and so dramatic in its details.
data/example/wavs/9302.wav|EN-default|EN|He had on neither collar nor neck.
data/example/wavs/9303.wav|EN-default|EN|the more featureless and commonplace a crime is
data/example/wavs/9304.wav|EN-default|EN|we should both be extremely obliged.
data/example/wavs/9305.wav|EN-default|EN|Women are naturally secretive.
data/example/wavs/9306.wav|EN-default|EN|Shortly after our return to England, my mother died.
data/example/wavs/9307.wav|EN-default|EN|You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago.
data/example/wavs/9308.wav|EN-default|EN|which are sent over to him by a correspondent,
data/example/wavs/9309.wav|EN-default|EN|Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,
data/example/wavs/9310.wav|EN-default|EN|Her father is very rich.
data/example/wavs/9311.wav|EN-default|EN|The old man sank his face in his hands.
data/example/wavs/9312.wav|EN-default|EN|found that I had given him up for dead,
data/example/wavs/9313.wav|EN-default|EN|but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason.
data/example/wavs/9314.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-indulgent
data/example/wavs/9315.wav|EN-default|EN|and of the better classes of the community in the South.
data/example/wavs/9316.wav|EN-default|EN|the presence of a band of gypsies who are
data/example/wavs/9317.wav|EN-default|EN|but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink.
data/example/wavs/9318.wav|EN-default|EN|As to who this prisoner is,
data/example/wavs/9319.wav|EN-default|EN|not knowing what was about to issue from it.
data/example/wavs/9320.wav|EN-default|EN|and it had left him with a weak throat, and he was dead.
data/example/wavs/9321.wav|EN-default|EN|When I pay good money for a good article, there should be an end of the business.
data/example/wavs/9322.wav|EN-default|EN|It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered,
data/example/wavs/9323.wav|EN-default|EN|The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.
data/example/wavs/9324.wav|EN-default|EN|It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience.
data/example/wavs/9325.wav|EN-default|EN|We shall take you away to your aunts at Harrow.
data/example/wavs/9326.wav|EN-default|EN|He ran up and down, sometimes losing,
data/example/wavs/9327.wav|EN-default|EN|the lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it.
data/example/wavs/9328.wav|EN-default|EN|but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward
data/example/wavs/9329.wav|EN-default|EN|lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
data/example/wavs/9330.wav|EN-default|EN|something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us
data/example/wavs/9331.wav|EN-default|EN|but a promise of secrecy was made at the time,
data/example/wavs/9332.wav|EN-default|EN|and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.
data/example/wavs/9333.wav|EN-default|EN|began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.
data/example/wavs/9334.wav|EN-default|EN|sinister quest upon which we were engaged.
data/example/wavs/9335.wav|EN-default|EN|My opinion is in no way altered.
data/example/wavs/9336.wav|EN-default|EN|Sometimes Holmes would hurry on,
data/example/wavs/9337.wav|EN-default|EN|and marry her at a registry office.
data/example/wavs/9338.wav|EN-default|EN|The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.
data/example/wavs/9339.wav|EN-default|EN|noting every little want and forestalling it,
data/example/wavs/9340.wav|EN-default|EN|You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary.
data/example/wavs/9341.wav|EN-default|EN|You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl.
data/example/wavs/9342.wav|EN-default|EN|than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring.
data/example/wavs/9343.wav|EN-default|EN|an old briar-pipe between his lips,
data/example/wavs/9344.wav|EN-default|EN|in andover in seventy seven
data/example/wavs/9345.wav|EN-default|EN|and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air.
data/example/wavs/9346.wav|EN-default|EN|heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.
data/example/wavs/9347.wav|EN-default|EN|for Dr. Roylett's conduct had long been notorious in the county,
data/example/wavs/9348.wav|EN-default|EN|heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
data/example/wavs/9349.wav|EN-default|EN|escapades with her wooden-legged lover
data/example/wavs/9350.wav|EN-default|EN|And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.
data/example/wavs/9351.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not so impossible, however.
data/example/wavs/9352.wav|EN-default|EN|for this was the third demand during the month.
data/example/wavs/9353.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, there are some on the stall with the gas flare.
data/example/wavs/9354.wav|EN-default|EN|But, after all, if he is satisfied,
data/example/wavs/9355.wav|EN-default|EN|and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most
data/example/wavs/9356.wav|EN-default|EN|Two attempts of the sort have already been made.
data/example/wavs/9357.wav|EN-default|EN|Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time.
data/example/wavs/9358.wav|EN-default|EN|Where were we going, and what were we to do?
data/example/wavs/9359.wav|EN-default|EN|and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street.
data/example/wavs/9360.wav|EN-default|EN|and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.
data/example/wavs/9361.wav|EN-default|EN|A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time.
data/example/wavs/9362.wav|EN-default|EN|A short railway journey and a shorter walk
data/example/wavs/9363.wav|EN-default|EN|I pray that we may never be exposed to such
data/example/wavs/9364.wav|EN-default|EN|passed his hand over his forehead.
data/example/wavs/9365.wav|EN-default|EN|absolute and complete silence before
data/example/wavs/9366.wav|EN-default|EN|In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him.
data/example/wavs/9367.wav|EN-default|EN|set fire to the wooden walls
data/example/wavs/9368.wav|EN-default|EN|We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
data/example/wavs/9369.wav|EN-default|EN|who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England.
data/example/wavs/9370.wav|EN-default|EN|I hardly noticed his appearance.
data/example/wavs/9371.wav|EN-default|EN|24 geese at 7 shillings 6 pence.
data/example/wavs/9372.wav|EN-default|EN|The temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you.
data/example/wavs/9373.wav|EN-default|EN|You said it should not be again.
data/example/wavs/9374.wav|EN-default|EN|No doubt you think me mad.
data/example/wavs/9375.wav|EN-default|EN|I was under the impression that I left this door shut.
data/example/wavs/9376.wav|EN-default|EN|for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to.
data/example/wavs/9377.wav|EN-default|EN|He has his own little methods, which are
data/example/wavs/9378.wav|EN-default|EN|These are the more patent facts which are to be deuced from this hat.
data/example/wavs/9379.wav|EN-default|EN|but of such purity and radiance that it
data/example/wavs/9380.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a jail.
data/example/wavs/9381.wav|EN-default|EN|and as my business come to me, instead of my having to go to it,
data/example/wavs/9382.wav|EN-default|EN|I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,
data/example/wavs/9383.wav|EN-default|EN|so far as to come and visit us.
data/example/wavs/9384.wav|EN-default|EN|You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers.
data/example/wavs/9385.wav|EN-default|EN|It is not an English paper at all.
data/example/wavs/9386.wav|EN-default|EN|and had just observed that the cornet had been twisted in the struggle,
data/example/wavs/9387.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall look into the matter between this and then.
data/example/wavs/9388.wav|EN-default|EN|three gilt balls and a brown board with Jabez Wilson in white letters,
data/example/wavs/9389.wav|EN-default|EN|will not prevent our children from being some day
data/example/wavs/9390.wav|EN-default|EN|Be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life.
data/example/wavs/9391.wav|EN-default|EN|On the contrary, my dear sir.
data/example/wavs/9392.wav|EN-default|EN|He swung himself up onto the roof.
data/example/wavs/9393.wav|EN-default|EN|sent to the marked man in some fantastic
data/example/wavs/9394.wav|EN-default|EN|It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it.
data/example/wavs/9395.wav|EN-default|EN|that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.
data/example/wavs/9396.wav|EN-default|EN|and a look of infinite languor in his face.
data/example/wavs/9397.wav|EN-default|EN|and by the aid of the water police the body was eventually recovered.
data/example/wavs/9398.wav|EN-default|EN|for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth,
data/example/wavs/9399.wav|EN-default|EN|Never trust to general impressions, my boy.
data/example/wavs/9400.wav|EN-default|EN|and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit
data/example/wavs/9401.wav|EN-default|EN|I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.
data/example/wavs/9402.wav|EN-default|EN|When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of,
data/example/wavs/9403.wav|EN-default|EN|in answer to an advertisement.
data/example/wavs/9404.wav|EN-default|EN|and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt
data/example/wavs/9405.wav|EN-default|EN|and there he sat with his eyes closed in his black clay pipe,
data/example/wavs/9406.wav|EN-default|EN|I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight.
data/example/wavs/9407.wav|EN-default|EN|I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held.
data/example/wavs/9408.wav|EN-default|EN|and in running his eye up and down the wall.
data/example/wavs/9409.wav|EN-default|EN|It is always awkward doing business with an alias.
data/example/wavs/9410.wav|EN-default|EN|was browsed so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation,

data/example/wavs/9412.wav|EN-default|EN|one of whom had remarkably small feet,
data/example/wavs/9413.wav|EN-default|EN|First to gross in Hanky's and Regent Street?
data/example/wavs/9414.wav|EN-default|EN|and started for the temple to see my husband.
data/example/wavs/9415.wav|EN-default|EN|then he passed his handkerchief over his brow,
data/example/wavs/9416.wav|EN-default|EN|Mrs. Rewcastle is not mad.
data/example/wavs/9417.wav|EN-default|EN|said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me,
data/example/wavs/9418.wav|EN-default|EN|and that I can deduce all that remains.
data/example/wavs/9419.wav|EN-default|EN|You would understand afterwards if I wanted your help.
data/example/wavs/9420.wav|EN-default|EN|pictured it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct
data/example/wavs/9421.wav|EN-default|EN|And you can do nothing until then?
data/example/wavs/9422.wav|EN-default|EN|but he had sold the lot at once.
data/example/wavs/9423.wav|EN-default|EN|I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark,
data/example/wavs/9424.wav|EN-default|EN|I was preoccupied with business matters.
data/example/wavs/9425.wav|EN-default|EN|which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune.
data/example/wavs/9426.wav|EN-default|EN|And now you see I had narrowed the field down considerably.
data/example/wavs/9427.wav|EN-default|EN|Some cold beef and a glass of beer.
data/example/wavs/9428.wav|EN-default|EN|Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face.
data/example/wavs/9429.wav|EN-default|EN|and that the bed was clamped to the floor.
data/example/wavs/9430.wav|EN-default|EN|Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/9431.wav|EN-default|EN|asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
data/example/wavs/9432.wav|EN-default|EN|and I am likely to be busier still this evening.
data/example/wavs/9433.wav|EN-default|EN|with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state,
data/example/wavs/9434.wav|EN-default|EN|which may have explained the presence of those
data/example/wavs/9435.wav|EN-default|EN|I will go when I have said my say.
data/example/wavs/9436.wav|EN-default|EN|that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public,
data/example/wavs/9437.wav|EN-default|EN|Every possible combination of events may be expected to take place.
data/example/wavs/9438.wav|EN-default|EN|to disturb the usual routine of our lives.
data/example/wavs/9439.wav|EN-default|EN|you are not very vulnerable from above.
data/example/wavs/9440.wav|EN-default|EN|It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton.
data/example/wavs/9441.wav|EN-default|EN|It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
data/example/wavs/9442.wav|EN-default|EN|then there is no more to be done in the matter.
data/example/wavs/9443.wav|EN-default|EN|was never weary of advertising my virtues,
data/example/wavs/9444.wav|EN-default|EN|and the little things that he would think of.
data/example/wavs/9445.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, I recall the case.
data/example/wavs/9446.wav|EN-default|EN|The whole garden has already been minutely examined.
data/example/wavs/9447.wav|EN-default|EN|I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure.
data/example/wavs/9448.wav|EN-default|EN|the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic
data/example/wavs/9449.wav|EN-default|EN|Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding
data/example/wavs/9450.wav|EN-default|EN|the fat manager and I behind him.
data/example/wavs/9451.wav|EN-default|EN|This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be
data/example/wavs/9452.wav|EN-default|EN|the man save his blazing red head.
data/example/wavs/9453.wav|EN-default|EN|and straight into the arms of Mr. Rewcastle, who was waiting outside.
data/example/wavs/9454.wav|EN-default|EN|would commence at one hundred pounds a year.
data/example/wavs/9455.wav|EN-default|EN|What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass?
data/example/wavs/9456.wav|EN-default|EN|I did not care to spend more money.
data/example/wavs/9457.wav|EN-default|EN|it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
data/example/wavs/9458.wav|EN-default|EN|and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me.
data/example/wavs/9459.wav|EN-default|EN|Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and,
data/example/wavs/9460.wav|EN-default|EN|He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself.
data/example/wavs/9461.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you go out much in society?
data/example/wavs/9462.wav|EN-default|EN|As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.
data/example/wavs/9463.wav|EN-default|EN|as they gave a last hurried glance around,
data/example/wavs/9464.wav|EN-default|EN|of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
data/example/wavs/9465.wav|EN-default|EN|I wired to Bristol for it last night.
data/example/wavs/9466.wav|EN-default|EN|though what it was that frightened her
data/example/wavs/9467.wav|EN-default|EN|There is a huge error which it may take some time to rectify.
data/example/wavs/9468.wav|EN-default|EN|Would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?'
data/example/wavs/9469.wav|EN-default|EN|at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections,
data/example/wavs/9470.wav|EN-default|EN|I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences.
data/example/wavs/9471.wav|EN-default|EN|which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.
data/example/wavs/9472.wav|EN-default|EN|Consider what is involved by your theory.
data/example/wavs/9473.wav|EN-default|EN|and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand.
data/example/wavs/9474.wav|EN-default|EN|drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,
data/example/wavs/9475.wav|EN-default|EN|And now let us hear a true account of the next act.
data/example/wavs/9476.wav|EN-default|EN|and nothing stranger than the result when viewed.
data/example/wavs/9477.wav|EN-default|EN|and I said nothing of the matter to the Ruecastles,
data/example/wavs/9478.wav|EN-default|EN|during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
data/example/wavs/9479.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.
data/example/wavs/9480.wav|EN-default|EN|looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it
data/example/wavs/9481.wav|EN-default|EN|So we may assume as a working hypothesis
data/example/wavs/9482.wav|EN-default|EN|He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight.
data/example/wavs/9483.wav|EN-default|EN|He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.
data/example/wavs/9484.wav|EN-default|EN|you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.
data/example/wavs/9485.wav|EN-default|EN|you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being
data/example/wavs/9486.wav|EN-default|EN|My sister thinks that I am going mad.
data/example/wavs/9487.wav|EN-default|EN|and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.
data/example/wavs/9488.wav|EN-default|EN|his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin,
data/example/wavs/9489.wav|EN-default|EN|Suddenly, to my surprise,
data/example/wavs/9490.wav|EN-default|EN|and lay half fainting upon the other side.
data/example/wavs/9491.wav|EN-default|EN|The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson,
data/example/wavs/9492.wav|EN-default|EN|and he glared down at me with the face of a demon.
data/example/wavs/9493.wav|EN-default|EN|but I hear the rumble of wheels.
data/example/wavs/9494.wav|EN-default|EN|It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.
data/example/wavs/9495.wav|EN-default|EN|You see this other page in red ink?
data/example/wavs/9496.wav|EN-default|EN|and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems,
data/example/wavs/9497.wav|EN-default|EN|a scissors grinder with his wheel,
data/example/wavs/9498.wav|EN-default|EN|A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect.
data/example/wavs/9499.wav|EN-default|EN|So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time.
data/example/wavs/9500.wav|EN-default|EN|as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.
data/example/wavs/9501.wav|EN-default|EN|but though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take all my time to break it.
data/example/wavs/9502.wav|EN-default|EN|He was a solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience,
data/example/wavs/9503.wav|EN-default|EN|but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
data/example/wavs/9504.wav|EN-default|EN|There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windebank.
data/example/wavs/9505.wav|EN-default|EN|you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures
data/example/wavs/9506.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have no doubt that we shall reach some
data/example/wavs/9507.wav|EN-default|EN|or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators.
data/example/wavs/9508.wav|EN-default|EN|The house was just such as I had
data/example/wavs/9509.wav|EN-default|EN|and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar
data/example/wavs/9510.wav|EN-default|EN|and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.
data/example/wavs/9511.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.
data/example/wavs/9512.wav|EN-default|EN|On Ely's number two is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist
data/example/wavs/9513.wav|EN-default|EN|and so too does his wit.
data/example/wavs/9514.wav|EN-default|EN|I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at
data/example/wavs/9515.wav|EN-default|EN|and if he had been some foul and venomous beast.
data/example/wavs/9516.wav|EN-default|EN|There is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
data/example/wavs/9517.wav|EN-default|EN|We've just had a little too much secrecy over this business already.
data/example/wavs/9518.wav|EN-default|EN|with dismantled shelves and open drawers,
data/example/wavs/9519.wav|EN-default|EN|Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.
data/example/wavs/9520.wav|EN-default|EN|you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy.
data/example/wavs/9521.wav|EN-default|EN|paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
data/example/wavs/9522.wav|EN-default|EN|they should do so as near each other as possible.
data/example/wavs/9523.wav|EN-default|EN|that that side is less illuminated than the other.
data/example/wavs/9524.wav|EN-default|EN|but he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital.
data/example/wavs/9525.wav|EN-default|EN|cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together.
data/example/wavs/9526.wav|EN-default|EN|But you have no notion as to what it
data/example/wavs/9527.wav|EN-default|EN|five miles on the far side of Winchester.
data/example/wavs/9528.wav|EN-default|EN|till at last my heart began to sink
data/example/wavs/9529.wav|EN-default|EN|There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.
data/example/wavs/9530.wav|EN-default|EN|I fear that I bore you with these details, but

data/example/wavs/9532.wav|EN-default|EN|uses a cigar holder
data/example/wavs/9533.wav|EN-default|EN|and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
data/example/wavs/9534.wav|EN-default|EN|laid out the grounds very nicely.
data/example/wavs/9535.wav|EN-default|EN|When I hear you.
data/example/wavs/9536.wav|EN-default|EN|It was, indeed, our friend the financier.
data/example/wavs/9537.wav|EN-default|EN|for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate,
data/example/wavs/9538.wav|EN-default|EN|but we provide this table and chair.
data/example/wavs/9539.wav|EN-default|EN|like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.
data/example/wavs/9540.wav|EN-default|EN|A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.
data/example/wavs/9541.wav|EN-default|EN|That's some evidence implicating flora millar in the
data/example/wavs/9542.wav|EN-default|EN|a quite epicurean little cold supper,
data/example/wavs/9543.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Rewcastle, then, I presume?
data/example/wavs/9544.wav|EN-default|EN|He begged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me in his way.
data/example/wavs/9545.wav|EN-default|EN|Thank you. I have not come to stay.
data/example/wavs/9546.wav|EN-default|EN|Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow."
data/example/wavs/9547.wav|EN-default|EN|Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking,
data/example/wavs/9548.wav|EN-default|EN|A man with so large a brain must have something in it.
data/example/wavs/9549.wav|EN-default|EN|with the utmost certainty that something had happened.
data/example/wavs/9550.wav|EN-default|EN|a sandwich and a cup of coffee,
data/example/wavs/9551.wav|EN-default|EN|The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the gamekeeper,
data/example/wavs/9552.wav|EN-default|EN|might have suggested the strange adjective which he used.
data/example/wavs/9553.wav|EN-default|EN|thrust away behind a curtain in the front room,
data/example/wavs/9554.wav|EN-default|EN|that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I
data/example/wavs/9555.wav|EN-default|EN|The bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive.
data/example/wavs/9556.wav|EN-default|EN|when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping,
data/example/wavs/9557.wav|EN-default|EN|and two people saw him as he passed over this ground.
data/example/wavs/9558.wav|EN-default|EN|At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army.
data/example/wavs/9559.wav|EN-default|EN|It has been a case of considerable interest.
data/example/wavs/9560.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
data/example/wavs/9561.wav|EN-default|EN|said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs
data/example/wavs/9562.wav|EN-default|EN|which was piled all round with crates and massive
data/example/wavs/9563.wav|EN-default|EN|and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.
data/example/wavs/9564.wav|EN-default|EN|the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
data/example/wavs/9565.wav|EN-default|EN|with the initials of KKK repeated upon it,
data/example/wavs/9566.wav|EN-default|EN|I should certainly speak to the police.
data/example/wavs/9567.wav|EN-default|EN|violence of temper approaching to mania.
data/example/wavs/9568.wav|EN-default|EN|Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked
data/example/wavs/9569.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!
data/example/wavs/9570.wav|EN-default|EN|it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure.
data/example/wavs/9571.wav|EN-default|EN|There was one about three miles off.
data/example/wavs/9572.wav|EN-default|EN|it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.
data/example/wavs/9573.wav|EN-default|EN|said he, with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature.
data/example/wavs/9574.wav|EN-default|EN|The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny.
data/example/wavs/9575.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me.
data/example/wavs/9576.wav|EN-default|EN|Anna used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle.
data/example/wavs/9577.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.
data/example/wavs/9578.wav|EN-default|EN|Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips.
data/example/wavs/9579.wav|EN-default|EN|What of this coo-ee, then?
data/example/wavs/9580.wav|EN-default|EN|There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock.
data/example/wavs/9581.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that it is very probable.
data/example/wavs/9582.wav|EN-default|EN|And it's read by Mark Smith of Simpsonville, South Carolina.
data/example/wavs/9583.wav|EN-default|EN|I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment.
data/example/wavs/9584.wav|EN-default|EN|He pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement.
data/example/wavs/9585.wav|EN-default|EN|without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness,
data/example/wavs/9586.wav|EN-default|EN|As I passed his pew on the way out, I dropped my bouquet over to him.
data/example/wavs/9587.wav|EN-default|EN|but his attention instantly became riveted
data/example/wavs/9588.wav|EN-default|EN|that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me.
data/example/wavs/9589.wav|EN-default|EN|as though to remember every feature.
data/example/wavs/9590.wav|EN-default|EN|could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell
data/example/wavs/9591.wav|EN-default|EN|I have made a small study of tattoo marks.
data/example/wavs/9592.wav|EN-default|EN|but how to get to him in safety.
data/example/wavs/9593.wav|EN-default|EN|I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon me for twenty-five pounds.
data/example/wavs/9594.wav|EN-default|EN|no one being present save the father of the bride,
data/example/wavs/9595.wav|EN-default|EN|and the stonework had been broken into.
data/example/wavs/9596.wav|EN-default|EN|reading the agony column of the Times, and smoking his before-breakfast pipe.
data/example/wavs/9597.wav|EN-default|EN|The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators,
data/example/wavs/9598.wav|EN-default|EN|The man burst into a hearty laugh.
data/example/wavs/9599.wav|EN-default|EN|that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
data/example/wavs/9600.wav|EN-default|EN|Might I ask you a question or two?
data/example/wavs/9601.wav|EN-default|EN|so that it flew upon the first person it saw.
data/example/wavs/9602.wav|EN-default|EN|Four golden sovereigns for my week's work.
data/example/wavs/9603.wav|EN-default|EN|It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case.
data/example/wavs/9604.wav|EN-default|EN|and the flooring was also thoroughly examined.
data/example/wavs/9605.wav|EN-default|EN|I took advantage now of my attainments.
data/example/wavs/9606.wav|EN-default|EN|said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left.
data/example/wavs/9607.wav|EN-default|EN|before he knew that his son had returned.
data/example/wavs/9608.wav|EN-default|EN|You will remember that I remarked the other day—
data/example/wavs/9609.wav|EN-default|EN|so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died.
data/example/wavs/9610.wav|EN-default|EN|and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.
data/example/wavs/9611.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Merriweather is the Chairman of Director
data/example/wavs/9612.wav|EN-default|EN|One of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square,
data/example/wavs/9613.wav|EN-default|EN|might have remained for ever a mystery.
data/example/wavs/9614.wav|EN-default|EN|sat Dr. Grimesby Roiland.
data/example/wavs/9615.wav|EN-default|EN|has come away from home with odd boots
data/example/wavs/9616.wav|EN-default|EN|Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed?
data/example/wavs/9617.wav|EN-default|EN|a little startled at my remark.
data/example/wavs/9618.wav|EN-default|EN|I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious.
data/example/wavs/9619.wav|EN-default|EN|But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.
data/example/wavs/9620.wav|EN-default|EN|and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other.
data/example/wavs/9621.wav|EN-default|EN|and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side.
data/example/wavs/9622.wav|EN-default|EN|No sound came from within.
data/example/wavs/9623.wav|EN-default|EN|from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half-wages
data/example/wavs/9624.wav|EN-default|EN|My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together.
data/example/wavs/9625.wav|EN-default|EN|They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.
data/example/wavs/9626.wav|EN-default|EN|I perceive that all is as it should be.
data/example/wavs/9627.wav|EN-default|EN|I took a good look at the man, and endeavoured.
data/example/wavs/9628.wav|EN-default|EN|One would think they were the only geese in the world.
data/example/wavs/9629.wav|EN-default|EN|and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation.
data/example/wavs/9630.wav|EN-default|EN|It is due at Winchester at 11.30.
data/example/wavs/9631.wav|EN-default|EN|on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
data/example/wavs/9632.wav|EN-default|EN|but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears.
data/example/wavs/9633.wav|EN-default|EN|for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.
data/example/wavs/9634.wav|EN-default|EN|which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else.
data/example/wavs/9635.wav|EN-default|EN|that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited,
data/example/wavs/9636.wav|EN-default|EN|her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty,
data/example/wavs/9637.wav|EN-default|EN|and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists.
data/example/wavs/9638.wav|EN-default|EN|I already feel it closing in upon me.
data/example/wavs/9639.wav|EN-default|EN|that on the day when my uncle burned the papers, I observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour.
data/example/wavs/9640.wav|EN-default|EN|On the third day after the coming of the letter, my father went from home to visit an old friend of his.
data/example/wavs/9641.wav|EN-default|EN|and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
data/example/wavs/9642.wav|EN-default|EN|You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct.'
data/example/wavs/9643.wav|EN-default|EN|It was quite against my wishes that she came.
data/example/wavs/9644.wav|EN-default|EN|I had better put my hat on, I suppose.
data/example/wavs/9645.wav|EN-default|EN|What did they say then of the disappearance of these gems?
data/example/wavs/9646.wav|EN-default|EN|Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough.
data/example/wavs/9647.wav|EN-default|EN|Nothing could be more successful.

data/example/wavs/9649.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that we may safely say,
data/example/wavs/9650.wav|EN-default|EN|The man who wrote it was presumably well to do.
data/example/wavs/9651.wav|EN-default|EN|I have been trained as an actress myself.
data/example/wavs/9652.wav|EN-default|EN|who had any influence with the savage creature.
data/example/wavs/9653.wav|EN-default|EN|It is really impossible for me to tell you.
data/example/wavs/9654.wav|EN-default|EN|observed Mr. Merriweather gloomily.
data/example/wavs/9655.wav|EN-default|EN|what use you could make of a hydraulic.
data/example/wavs/9656.wav|EN-default|EN|and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.
data/example/wavs/9657.wav|EN-default|EN|but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.
data/example/wavs/9658.wav|EN-default|EN|Finally, he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk

data/example/wavs/9660.wav|EN-default|EN|The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped,
data/example/wavs/9661.wav|EN-default|EN|She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
data/example/wavs/9662.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more.
data/example/wavs/9663.wav|EN-default|EN|goodness to sit down upon one of these boxes?
data/example/wavs/9664.wav|EN-default|EN|to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.
data/example/wavs/9665.wav|EN-default|EN|also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father,
data/example/wavs/9666.wav|EN-default|EN|And I feel dissatisfied.
data/example/wavs/9667.wav|EN-default|EN|but friend lestrade held information in his hands

data/example/wavs/9669.wav|EN-default|EN|living in London quite so.
data/example/wavs/9670.wav|EN-default|EN|and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
data/example/wavs/9671.wav|EN-default|EN|and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt,
data/example/wavs/9672.wav|EN-default|EN|and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket.
data/example/wavs/9673.wav|EN-default|EN|When I was a youngster, I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.
data/example/wavs/9674.wav|EN-default|EN|If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.
data/example/wavs/9675.wav|EN-default|EN|They were always very careful, I observed.
data/example/wavs/9676.wav|EN-default|EN|Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.
data/example/wavs/9677.wav|EN-default|EN|And how came the goose into the open market?
data/example/wavs/9678.wav|EN-default|EN|You will excuse me for not waiting for you.
data/example/wavs/9679.wav|EN-default|EN|No, no, the real name.
data/example/wavs/9680.wav|EN-default|EN|Tomorrow I shall set to work upon your case.
data/example/wavs/9681.wav|EN-default|EN|But pray tell me, before we go farther,
data/example/wavs/9682.wav|EN-default|EN|there is plenty of time to do so.
data/example/wavs/9683.wav|EN-default|EN|It was of excellent material.
data/example/wavs/9684.wav|EN-default|EN|is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshot.
data/example/wavs/9685.wav|EN-default|EN|a small bearded man in a grey suit,
data/example/wavs/9686.wav|EN-default|EN|It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble.
data/example/wavs/9687.wav|EN-default|EN|which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
data/example/wavs/9688.wav|EN-default|EN|it would break their hearts.
data/example/wavs/9689.wav|EN-default|EN|or when he refers to her photograph.
data/example/wavs/9690.wav|EN-default|EN|and when the cabman got down from the box and looked
data/example/wavs/9691.wav|EN-default|EN|I suppose you know all about it.
data/example/wavs/9692.wav|EN-default|EN|but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed.
data/example/wavs/9693.wav|EN-default|EN|She hurried across the road, and we heard the shark
data/example/wavs/9694.wav|EN-default|EN|and it could at once see that someone had passed out.
data/example/wavs/9695.wav|EN-default|EN|was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist.
data/example/wavs/9696.wav|EN-default|EN|to my wife as an old friend and school companion.
data/example/wavs/9697.wav|EN-default|EN|finding that he had the coronet in his hands,

data/example/wavs/9700.wav|EN-default|EN|They could only have come from the old man at my side.
data/example/wavs/9701.wav|EN-default|EN|but in a month or six weeks I shall be married.
data/example/wavs/9702.wav|EN-default|EN|It will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.'
data/example/wavs/9703.wav|EN-default|EN|The nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.

data/example/wavs/9705.wav|EN-default|EN|and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want,
data/example/wavs/9706.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, I saw it by the side lights.
data/example/wavs/9707.wav|EN-default|EN|where she found matters as described by the last witness.
data/example/wavs/9708.wav|EN-default|EN|There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horus.
data/example/wavs/9709.wav|EN-default|EN|Now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning.
data/example/wavs/9710.wav|EN-default|EN|The deed had been overseen by your son.
data/example/wavs/9711.wav|EN-default|EN|gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope.
data/example/wavs/9712.wav|EN-default|EN|sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand
data/example/wavs/9713.wav|EN-default|EN|to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him.
data/example/wavs/9714.wav|EN-default|EN|and I feel that I must leave you forever.
data/example/wavs/9715.wav|EN-default|EN|I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo.
data/example/wavs/9716.wav|EN-default|EN|and an occasional friend of arthur's,
data/example/wavs/9717.wav|EN-default|EN|I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private
data/example/wavs/9718.wav|EN-default|EN|That's all right, said he, coming back.
data/example/wavs/9719.wav|EN-default|EN|but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.
data/example/wavs/9720.wav|EN-default|EN|Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.
data/example/wavs/9721.wav|EN-default|EN|I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.
data/example/wavs/9722.wav|EN-default|EN|with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.
data/example/wavs/9723.wav|EN-default|EN|but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a businessman.
data/example/wavs/9724.wav|EN-default|EN|At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
data/example/wavs/9725.wav|EN-default|EN|and so he came right away round to his rooms at once.
data/example/wavs/9726.wav|EN-default|EN|James and his father had many disagreements about me.
data/example/wavs/9727.wav|EN-default|EN|I knew little of my former friend.
data/example/wavs/9728.wav|EN-default|EN|and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
data/example/wavs/9729.wav|EN-default|EN|But more valuable still was it to know that
data/example/wavs/9730.wav|EN-default|EN|Let us have everything in its due order.
data/example/wavs/9731.wav|EN-default|EN|It is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning.
data/example/wavs/9732.wav|EN-default|EN|bodies lying in strange fantastic poses.
data/example/wavs/9733.wav|EN-default|EN|when they could have their pick for 40 pounds.
data/example/wavs/9734.wav|EN-default|EN|while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
data/example/wavs/9735.wav|EN-default|EN|and yesterday evening he was very drunk.
data/example/wavs/9736.wav|EN-default|EN|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/9737.wav|EN-default|EN|and a long straight chin suggested of resolution,
data/example/wavs/9738.wav|EN-default|EN|that the gang of roughs who assaulted me
data/example/wavs/9739.wav|EN-default|EN|I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.
data/example/wavs/9740.wav|EN-default|EN|Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
data/example/wavs/9741.wav|EN-default|EN|She had small round hanging gold earrings.

data/example/wavs/9743.wav|EN-default|EN|destined to fall into the hands of justice.
data/example/wavs/9744.wav|EN-default|EN|Here is a very fashionable epistle.
data/example/wavs/9745.wav|EN-default|EN|if we have an answer to our advertisement.
data/example/wavs/9746.wav|EN-default|EN|There are no lengths to which she would not go.
data/example/wavs/9747.wav|EN-default|EN|and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rested upon the desk.
data/example/wavs/9748.wav|EN-default|EN|which is less than my average takings,
data/example/wavs/9749.wav|EN-default|EN|My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me.
data/example/wavs/9750.wav|EN-default|EN|He was a remarkably handsome man.
data/example/wavs/9751.wav|EN-default|EN|and spotted in several places
data/example/wavs/9752.wav|EN-default|EN|Gone was the coarse brown tint.
data/example/wavs/9753.wav|EN-default|EN|I paced up and down the room.
data/example/wavs/9754.wav|EN-default|EN|He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand.
data/example/wavs/9755.wav|EN-default|EN|and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.
data/example/wavs/9756.wav|EN-default|EN|and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.
data/example/wavs/9757.wav|EN-default|EN|some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper.
data/example/wavs/9758.wav|EN-default|EN|I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same
data/example/wavs/9759.wav|EN-default|EN|My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
data/example/wavs/9760.wav|EN-default|EN|She was very independent in little matters like that.
data/example/wavs/9761.wav|EN-default|EN|It was very nice and complimentary of you.
data/example/wavs/9762.wav|EN-default|EN|With a shriek of joy, our client clutched it up.
data/example/wavs/9763.wav|EN-default|EN|without anyone having a suspicion as to my real

data/example/wavs/9765.wav|EN-default|EN|Sarasate plays at St. James's Hall this afternoon.
data/example/wavs/9766.wav|EN-default|EN|I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.
data/example/wavs/9767.wav|EN-default|EN|he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
data/example/wavs/9768.wav|EN-default|EN|and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has
data/example/wavs/9769.wav|EN-default|EN|She raised her veil as she spoke,
data/example/wavs/9770.wav|EN-default|EN|consciousness that she had made so immense

data/example/wavs/9773.wav|EN-default|EN|and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated,
data/example/wavs/9774.wav|EN-default|EN|announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
data/example/wavs/9775.wav|EN-default|EN|Where did you address your letters, then?
data/example/wavs/9776.wav|EN-default|EN|she had some secret sorrow.
data/example/wavs/9777.wav|EN-default|EN|abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
data/example/wavs/9778.wav|EN-default|EN|up to a late hour last night, however.
data/example/wavs/9779.wav|EN-default|EN|That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes.
data/example/wavs/9780.wav|EN-default|EN|while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with
data/example/wavs/9781.wav|EN-default|EN|This LibriVox recording is in the public domain.
data/example/wavs/9782.wav|EN-default|EN|and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me and yours also.
data/example/wavs/9783.wav|EN-default|EN|But when I got into the stable lane,
data/example/wavs/9784.wav|EN-default|EN|will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
data/example/wavs/9785.wav|EN-default|EN|and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.
data/example/wavs/9786.wav|EN-default|EN|I got a few patients from among the
data/example/wavs/9787.wav|EN-default|EN|and there is a little reward, I fancy.
data/example/wavs/9788.wav|EN-default|EN|Where are we to find the photograph?
data/example/wavs/9789.wav|EN-default|EN|I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.
data/example/wavs/9790.wav|EN-default|EN|I have seen those symptoms before.

data/example/wavs/9795.wav|EN-default|EN|and at the small morocco casket in which
data/example/wavs/9796.wav|EN-default|EN|the lens discloses a large number of hair ends,
data/example/wavs/9797.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope.

data/example/wavs/9801.wav|EN-default|EN|I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear.
data/example/wavs/9802.wav|EN-default|EN|as he loved his cousin, however.
data/example/wavs/9803.wav|EN-default|EN|If you come pestering me anymore with your silly talk, I'll set the dog at you.
data/example/wavs/9804.wav|EN-default|EN|So closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding.
data/example/wavs/9805.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet if it were on the lawn

data/example/wavs/9809.wav|EN-default|EN|we are to be found in the museum itself.
data/example/wavs/9810.wav|EN-default|EN|he shot one of his suspicious looks at me.

data/example/wavs/9812.wav|EN-default|EN|that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.
data/example/wavs/9813.wav|EN-default|EN|and there was something of the sort at the Hague last year.
data/example/wavs/9814.wav|EN-default|EN|which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman.
data/example/wavs/9815.wav|EN-default|EN|It would, of course, instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.
data/example/wavs/9816.wav|EN-default|EN|Not more than thirty, I should think.'
data/example/wavs/9817.wav|EN-default|EN|he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

data/example/wavs/9826.wav|EN-default|EN|Only one little item in another of the morning papers,
data/example/wavs/9827.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known Dad in the old days in Victoria.
data/example/wavs/9828.wav|EN-default|EN|as far as the child is concerned,
data/example/wavs/9829.wav|EN-default|EN|Do not lose an instant.
data/example/wavs/9830.wav|EN-default|EN|we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude
data/example/wavs/9831.wav|EN-default|EN|and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches

data/example/wavs/9835.wav|EN-default|EN|I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle.

data/example/wavs/9838.wav|EN-default|EN|He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post.

data/example/wavs/9840.wav|EN-default|EN|Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead.
data/example/wavs/9841.wav|EN-default|EN|I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon.'
data/example/wavs/9842.wav|EN-default|EN|You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.
data/example/wavs/9843.wav|EN-default|EN|I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more.
data/example/wavs/9844.wav|EN-default|EN|I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
data/example/wavs/9845.wav|EN-default|EN|when up the lane comes a neat little landau.
data/example/wavs/9846.wav|EN-default|EN|Did you give Lucy the maid leave to go out to-night?
data/example/wavs/9847.wav|EN-default|EN|Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung out.
data/example/wavs/9848.wav|EN-default|EN|The name of the maker, no doubt.
data/example/wavs/9849.wav|EN-default|EN|I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
data/example/wavs/9850.wav|EN-default|EN|when pursued by so formidable an antagonist.
data/example/wavs/9851.wav|EN-default|EN|I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room.
data/example/wavs/9852.wav|EN-default|EN|but I would not have let the young man come to harm.
data/example/wavs/9853.wav|EN-default|EN|until after the alarm of fire I had not a suspicion.
data/example/wavs/9854.wav|EN-default|EN|If it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved,
data/example/wavs/9855.wav|EN-default|EN|It becomes a personal matter with me now.
data/example/wavs/9856.wav|EN-default|EN|not more than seven hundred fifty pounds.
data/example/wavs/9857.wav|EN-default|EN|but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him
data/example/wavs/9858.wav|EN-default|EN|He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning.
data/example/wavs/9859.wav|EN-default|EN|I see many objections to any such theory.
data/example/wavs/9860.wav|EN-default|EN|Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.
data/example/wavs/9861.wav|EN-default|EN|your life may depend upon your compliance.

data/example/wavs/9863.wav|EN-default|EN|I heard the sharp rattling of a chain.
data/example/wavs/9864.wav|EN-default|EN|He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am.
data/example/wavs/9865.wav|EN-default|EN|and only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence.
data/example/wavs/9866.wav|EN-default|EN|and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door, I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room,

data/example/wavs/9883.wav|EN-default|EN|I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.'
data/example/wavs/9884.wav|EN-default|EN|Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in Frisco.
data/example/wavs/9885.wav|EN-default|EN|He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home.
data/example/wavs/9886.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, she has turned all the men's head down in that

data/example/wavs/9892.wav|EN-default|EN|What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?
data/example/wavs/9893.wav|EN-default|EN|they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews

data/example/wavs/9895.wav|EN-default|EN|I fail to see how you work it out.
data/example/wavs/9896.wav|EN-default|EN|and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock.

data/example/wavs/9908.wav|EN-default|EN|In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there.
data/example/wavs/9909.wav|EN-default|EN|I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves.
data/example/wavs/9910.wav|EN-default|EN|We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.

data/example/wavs/9960.wav|EN-default|EN|It struck me as being a little out of the common.
data/example/wavs/9961.wav|EN-default|EN|on intimate terms with this old doctor,
data/example/wavs/9962.wav|EN-default|EN|dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever,

data/example/wavs/9967.wav|EN-default|EN|Terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.

data/example/wavs/9972.wav|EN-default|EN|I should not dream of doing so were it not
data/example/wavs/9973.wav|EN-default|EN|No, it is not selfishness or conceit.

data/example/wavs/9993.wav|EN-default|EN|Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?'
data/example/wavs/9994.wav|EN-default|EN|but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again.
data/example/wavs/9995.wav|EN-default|EN|Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.

data/example/wavs/9997.wav|EN-default|EN|In the first place, I may say that I have met
data/example/wavs/9998.wav|EN-default|EN|Very few governesses in England are getting
data/example/wavs/9999.wav|EN-default|EN|and its value can only be conjectured.
data/example/wavs/10000.wav|EN-default|EN|Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady.

data/example/wavs/10003.wav|EN-default|EN|The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle.
data/example/wavs/10004.wav|EN-default|EN|he had some strong motive for securing the situation.
data/example/wavs/10005.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly
data/example/wavs/10006.wav|EN-default|EN|and we wish your advice upon the subject.
data/example/wavs/10007.wav|EN-default|EN|there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child,
data/example/wavs/10008.wav|EN-default|EN|that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely.
data/example/wavs/10009.wav|EN-default|EN|and of late years that has not done more than just
data/example/wavs/10010.wav|EN-default|EN|I know that everything was turning round,
data/example/wavs/10011.wav|EN-default|EN|that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it.
data/example/wavs/10012.wav|EN-default|EN|it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
data/example/wavs/10013.wav|EN-default|EN|and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay,
data/example/wavs/10014.wav|EN-default|EN|rushing to my confidante, the last car,

data/example/wavs/10017.wav|EN-default|EN|threw across his case of cigars.
data/example/wavs/10018.wav|EN-default|EN|but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks.
data/example/wavs/10019.wav|EN-default|EN|Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
data/example/wavs/10020.wav|EN-default|EN|Which key was used to open it?

data/example/wavs/10030.wav|EN-default|EN|as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
data/example/wavs/10031.wav|EN-default|EN|I have every reason to believe that I will succeed.

data/example/wavs/10044.wav|EN-default|EN|But I have heard that the crocuses promise well.
data/example/wavs/10045.wav|EN-default|EN|Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.
data/example/wavs/10046.wav|EN-default|EN|From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character.
data/example/wavs/10047.wav|EN-default|EN|What did she do on re-entering her father's house?
data/example/wavs/10048.wav|EN-default|EN|even as science lost an acute reasoner.
data/example/wavs/10049.wav|EN-default|EN|at which my friend lashed so savagely.

data/example/wavs/10073.wav|EN-default|EN|One of them held the horse's head while the other

data/example/wavs/10092.wav|EN-default|EN|You were not yourself at fault at all, then.
data/example/wavs/10093.wav|EN-default|EN|I sent him a couple of dozen.
data/example/wavs/10094.wav|EN-default|EN|Above all, why did you not come at once?

data/example/wavs/10110.wav|EN-default|EN|all the results which would follow from it.

data/example/wavs/10112.wav|EN-default|EN|a lumber room up among the attics.
data/example/wavs/10113.wav|EN-default|EN|and one who was at home in the district.

data/example/wavs/10126.wav|EN-default|EN|He opened the gladstone bag as he spoke,
data/example/wavs/10127.wav|EN-default|EN|fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.
data/example/wavs/10128.wav|EN-default|EN|It was a curious way of managing it.
data/example/wavs/10129.wav|EN-default|EN|I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you.
data/example/wavs/10130.wav|EN-default|EN|Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?
data/example/wavs/10131.wav|EN-default|EN|And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case.
data/example/wavs/10132.wav|EN-default|EN|and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes's cases.
data/example/wavs/10133.wav|EN-default|EN|is to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica.
data/example/wavs/10134.wav|EN-default|EN|It seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once.

data/example/wavs/10136.wav|EN-default|EN|was decoyed away by Flora Millar.
data/example/wavs/10137.wav|EN-default|EN|Finally, he returned to the pawnbroker's.
data/example/wavs/10138.wav|EN-default|EN|snuff that he is a freemason
data/example/wavs/10139.wav|EN-default|EN|a not over-clean black frock-coat,
data/example/wavs/10140.wav|EN-default|EN|I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and
data/example/wavs/10141.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, but very small ones.
data/example/wavs/10142.wav|EN-default|EN|Remember the card upon the bird's leg.
data/example/wavs/10143.wav|EN-default|EN|he asked in a quavering voice.
data/example/wavs/10144.wav|EN-default|EN|said Holmes, laying down the volume.
data/example/wavs/10145.wav|EN-default|EN|learned that his master had cut his head the night before.
data/example/wavs/10146.wav|EN-default|EN|the longer time they will have for their escape.
data/example/wavs/10147.wav|EN-default|EN|in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.
data/example/wavs/10148.wav|EN-default|EN|He never did wish us to go anywhere.
data/example/wavs/10149.wav|EN-default|EN|Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?'
data/example/wavs/10150.wav|EN-default|EN|before I decide upon our course of action.
data/example/wavs/10151.wav|EN-default|EN|but when I looked back to the weird business of the sign of four,
data/example/wavs/10152.wav|EN-default|EN|there was something depressing and subduing.
data/example/wavs/10153.wav|EN-default|EN|Two years have passed since then.
data/example/wavs/10154.wav|EN-default|EN|thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it.
data/example/wavs/10155.wav|EN-default|EN|he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided.
data/example/wavs/10156.wav|EN-default|EN|and found him standing by the pool.
data/example/wavs/10157.wav|EN-default|EN|I remember that it was full of papers.
data/example/wavs/10158.wav|EN-default|EN|He answered that the name was new to him.
data/example/wavs/10159.wav|EN-default|EN|He took up the paper in a listless way.
data/example/wavs/10160.wav|EN-default|EN|of the banking firm of holder and stevenson
data/example/wavs/10161.wav|EN-default|EN|The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol.
data/example/wavs/10162.wav|EN-default|EN|It is to him that this trophy belongs.
data/example/wavs/10163.wav|EN-default|EN|until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.
data/example/wavs/10164.wav|EN-default|EN|wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street.
data/example/wavs/10165.wav|EN-default|EN|and so by way of the woods to
data/example/wavs/10166.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet be ignorant of his death?
data/example/wavs/10167.wav|EN-default|EN|What do you imagine that it means?
data/example/wavs/10168.wav|EN-default|EN|and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.
data/example/wavs/10169.wav|EN-default|EN|The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Duran, at Lancaster Gate,
data/example/wavs/10170.wav|EN-default|EN|I will make no allowance.
data/example/wavs/10171.wav|EN-default|EN|My sister and I, you will recollect,
data/example/wavs/10172.wav|EN-default|EN|Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church?
data/example/wavs/10173.wav|EN-default|EN|swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.
data/example/wavs/10174.wav|EN-default|EN|The other is a good three pound heavier.
data/example/wavs/10175.wav|EN-default|EN|and how all-important it was to set it right.
data/example/wavs/10176.wav|EN-default|EN|Then pray send him home in it.
data/example/wavs/10177.wav|EN-default|EN|All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
data/example/wavs/10178.wav|EN-default|EN|with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
data/example/wavs/10179.wav|EN-default|EN|and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten.
data/example/wavs/10180.wav|EN-default|EN|and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step
data/example/wavs/10181.wav|EN-default|EN|You cannot say what it was?
data/example/wavs/10182.wav|EN-default|EN|I have devised seven separate explanations
data/example/wavs/10183.wav|EN-default|EN|who is to be our companion in tonight's adventure.
data/example/wavs/10184.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, yes, sir, I have only just left him.
data/example/wavs/10185.wav|EN-default|EN|just as I was thinking of leaving the office,
data/example/wavs/10186.wav|EN-default|EN|Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so.
data/example/wavs/10187.wav|EN-default|EN|Set your foot over the threshold at night.
data/example/wavs/10188.wav|EN-default|EN|with what you earn into the bargain
data/example/wavs/10189.wav|EN-default|EN|You know Father didn't like anything of the sort.
data/example/wavs/10190.wav|EN-default|EN|if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal.
data/example/wavs/10191.wav|EN-default|EN|On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beaches,
data/example/wavs/10192.wav|EN-default|EN|and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice.
data/example/wavs/10193.wav|EN-default|EN|You said that she had ceased to love him.
data/example/wavs/10194.wav|EN-default|EN|A moment later we were out on the dark road.
data/example/wavs/10195.wav|EN-default|EN|beating upon her eager and beautiful
data/example/wavs/10196.wav|EN-default|EN|He spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.
data/example/wavs/10197.wav|EN-default|EN|The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.
data/example/wavs/10198.wav|EN-default|EN|The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.
data/example/wavs/10199.wav|EN-default|EN|She left her room, therefore, and came into mine.
data/example/wavs/10200.wav|EN-default|EN|This hat has not been brushed for weeks.
data/example/wavs/10201.wav|EN-default|EN|for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.
data/example/wavs/10202.wav|EN-default|EN|when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer.
data/example/wavs/10203.wav|EN-default|EN|You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.
data/example/wavs/10204.wav|EN-default|EN|He sank his face into his thin white hands.
data/example/wavs/10205.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in.
data/example/wavs/10206.wav|EN-default|EN|But what then did the gypsies do?
data/example/wavs/10207.wav|EN-default|EN|Well, it is a possible supposition.
data/example/wavs/10208.wav|EN-default|EN|Again Holmes raved in the air.
data/example/wavs/10209.wav|EN-default|EN|I was amused by her society.
data/example/wavs/10210.wav|EN-default|EN|From my position I could look over the case and the direction of the floor.
data/example/wavs/10211.wav|EN-default|EN|and having met you succeeded by certain arguments
data/example/wavs/10212.wav|EN-default|EN|in which I ever found myself in my life.
data/example/wavs/10213.wav|EN-default|EN|but I must be back before three o'clock.
data/example/wavs/10214.wav|EN-default|EN|while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction
data/example/wavs/10215.wav|EN-default|EN|without either his gun or his hat.
data/example/wavs/10216.wav|EN-default|EN|and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eifert for its centre.
data/example/wavs/10217.wav|EN-default|EN|whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.
data/example/wavs/10218.wav|EN-default|EN|were all matters which are outside the pale of the law.
data/example/wavs/10219.wav|EN-default|EN|He received us in his quietly genial fashion.
data/example/wavs/10220.wav|EN-default|EN|Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.
data/example/wavs/10221.wav|EN-default|EN|and humdrum routine of everyday life.
data/example/wavs/10222.wav|EN-default|EN|that he had deserved your warmest thanks.
data/example/wavs/10223.wav|EN-default|EN|but the reward offered of one thousand pounds
data/example/wavs/10224.wav|EN-default|EN|I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening.
data/example/wavs/10225.wav|EN-default|EN|who was by all accounts a very hard man,
data/example/wavs/10226.wav|EN-default|EN|belonged to a man with naked feet.
data/example/wavs/10227.wav|EN-default|EN|so we may put our little problem upon the shelf.
data/example/wavs/10228.wav|EN-default|EN|far away from the glamour of his presence.
data/example/wavs/10229.wav|EN-default|EN|for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.
data/example/wavs/10230.wav|EN-default|EN|150 guineas apiece.
data/example/wavs/10231.wav|EN-default|EN|with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace,
data/example/wavs/10232.wav|EN-default|EN|that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears.
data/example/wavs/10233.wav|EN-default|EN|as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday,
data/example/wavs/10234.wav|EN-default|EN|and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
data/example/wavs/10235.wav|EN-default|EN|with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy births to men whose hair is of that colour.
data/example/wavs/10236.wav|EN-default|EN|I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you.
data/example/wavs/10237.wav|EN-default|EN|Obviously something had occurred during the morning then.
data/example/wavs/10238.wav|EN-default|EN|as far as you are personally concerned.
data/example/wavs/10239.wav|EN-default|EN|said he, sitting down and flattening out upon his knee.
data/example/wavs/10240.wav|EN-default|EN|Then the fact that the two men were never together,
data/example/wavs/10241.wav|EN-default|EN|seems to indicate some evil influence.
data/example/wavs/10242.wav|EN-default|EN|for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.
data/example/wavs/10243.wav|EN-default|EN|on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner,
data/example/wavs/10244.wav|EN-default|EN|Then that explains what the girl said.
data/example/wavs/10245.wav|EN-default|EN|and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up.
data/example/wavs/10246.wav|EN-default|EN|but I again the cover of the wood.
data/example/wavs/10247.wav|EN-default|EN|Lord Robert St. Simon.
data/example/wavs/10248.wav|EN-default|EN|You have a grand gift of silence, Watson.
data/example/wavs/10249.wav|EN-default|EN|Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.
data/example/wavs/10250.wav|EN-default|EN|but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.
data/example/wavs/10251.wav|EN-default|EN|The richer Pa grew, the poorer was Frank.
data/example/wavs/10252.wav|EN-default|EN|I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.
data/example/wavs/10253.wav|EN-default|EN|that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers
data/example/wavs/10254.wav|EN-default|EN|examining minutely the cracks between the boards.
data/example/wavs/10255.wav|EN-default|EN|On the other side of this narrow wing,
data/example/wavs/10256.wav|EN-default|EN|It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble Lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger.
data/example/wavs/10257.wav|EN-default|EN|He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room.
data/example/wavs/10258.wav|EN-default|EN|The man's business was a small one.
data/example/wavs/10259.wav|EN-default|EN|from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman
data/example/wavs/10260.wav|EN-default|EN|as one who finds himself in a perplexing
data/example/wavs/10261.wav|EN-default|EN|whereas unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound,
data/example/wavs/10262.wav|EN-default|EN|Breakfast, two shillings, six pence.
data/example/wavs/10263.wav|EN-default|EN|and I went off to make my own arrangements.
data/example/wavs/10264.wav|EN-default|EN|What have you to say now?
data/example/wavs/10265.wav|EN-default|EN|Yet it appeared to me that the night must
data/example/wavs/10266.wav|EN-default|EN|But was there another with a barred tail?
data/example/wavs/10267.wav|EN-default|EN|would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth.
data/example/wavs/10268.wav|EN-default|EN|marks him as either an innocent man
data/example/wavs/10269.wav|EN-default|EN|Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though.
data/example/wavs/10270.wav|EN-default|EN|But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.
data/example/wavs/10271.wav|EN-default|EN|we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel
data/example/wavs/10272.wav|EN-default|EN|who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate,
data/example/wavs/10273.wav|EN-default|EN|I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap
data/example/wavs/10274.wav|EN-default|EN|he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent,
data/example/wavs/10275.wav|EN-default|EN|To my surprise, the question provoked a burst of
data/example/wavs/10276.wav|EN-default|EN|and pressed down the levers which controlled it,
data/example/wavs/10277.wav|EN-default|EN|and in so frightful a form,
data/example/wavs/10278.wav|EN-default|EN|and Lady Alicia Whittington.
data/example/wavs/10279.wav|EN-default|EN|and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.
data/example/wavs/10280.wav|EN-default|EN|I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.
data/example/wavs/10281.wav|EN-default|EN|I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
data/example/wavs/10282.wav|EN-default|EN|and right up to the steps which led to the office.
data/example/wavs/10283.wav|EN-default|EN|we have had some skirmishes
data/example/wavs/10284.wav|EN-default|EN|course, I must use the official police as well.
data/example/wavs/10285.wav|EN-default|EN|so much public attention has now been drawn to it
data/example/wavs/10286.wav|EN-default|EN|but the others were there before us.
data/example/wavs/10287.wav|EN-default|EN|and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighboring fields.
data/example/wavs/10288.wav|EN-default|EN|said I, sitting down in my library chair.
data/example/wavs/10289.wav|EN-default|EN|even in these days of free education and encyclopedias,
data/example/wavs/10290.wav|EN-default|EN|This he opened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.
data/example/wavs/10291.wav|EN-default|EN|He rushed down just as he was and he was
data/example/wavs/10292.wav|EN-default|EN|Oh, we shall soon clear up all that.
data/example/wavs/10293.wav|EN-default|EN|Since you are interested in these little problems,
data/example/wavs/10294.wav|EN-default|EN|but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours.
data/example/wavs/10295.wav|EN-default|EN|But you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.
